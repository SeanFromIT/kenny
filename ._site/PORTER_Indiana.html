Christy and Tony Venandor were in their backyard in Porter,Indiana when they recorded these images of a light streaking across thesky. You can see it right above the treeline.

Considering the hazing of the atmosphere that night,the light they saw conceivably could of been a satellite, with the lightof the sun reflecting off the its surface and the haze in the sky reflectingthe light produced by the satellite making the light look like some sortof flame or tail. The same illusion could also be produced by the lightof a passing aircraft.&nbsp;</font></font><font face="Arial,Helvetica"><font color="#5DBACA"></font></font><p><font face="Arial,Helvetica"><font color="#5DBACA">According to thetear drop shape, it is extremely plausible that this also could have beenjet exhaust. Especially so since the shape explained by the witnesses was"...a white dot being trailed by flames." The white dot would of been thedirect flame from the turbofan engine of a jet, and the flame would bethe fading, flaming exhaust. And since the exhaust itself would be morebrilliant the the plane, the eye would be attracted to the flame not theplane. The light only went straight, the jet explanation is plausible,but it depends on if it was at night or during the day.&nbsp;</font></font><font face="Arial,Helvetica"><font color="#5DBACA"></font></font><p><font face="Arial,Helvetica"><font color="#5DBACA">Nathan C.
