<P><FONT COLOR="#FFFF00"><FONT SIZE=-1>July 12, 1996: <BR>
PRESS RELEASE</FONT></FONT> </P>

<P><FONT COLOR="#FFFF00"><FONT SIZE=-1>The research organization Tri-State
Advocates for Scientific Knowledge has exhaustively investigated the reported
Middletown UFO Disturbances that occurred on July 4, 5 and 6. On Thursday
night, July 11 at 10:45 P.M., T.A.S.K. solved the mystery.</FONT></FONT></P>

<P><FONT COLOR="#FFFF00"><FONT SIZE=-1>An eerie, self-luminous red object
appeared and held in position at a high elevation shortly after 10:00 P.M.
above the Middletown area, sending droves of befuddled residents milling
into the streets in confusion and wonderment. Even traffic stalled in some
quarters as the Middletown Police Department sought furiously to track
the movement of the phantasmal specter amidst an unstoppable flurry of
phone calls from kindly residents.</FONT></FONT></P>

<P><FONT COLOR="#FFFF00"><FONT SIZE=-1>In a scene of great drama, T.A.S.K.
investigator DALE FARMER struggled frantically through the streets and
residential neighborhoods to pursue and document the strange event on videotape.</FONT></FONT></P>

<P><FONT COLOR="#FFFF00"><FONT SIZE=-1>His unshakable determination led
him to enact the foot pursuit of airplane that circled the object at close
range. Upon chasing down the pilot of the plane which landed at Hook Airfield,
Farmer was advised by the pilot that the object had been a red flare attached
to and dangling from underneath two large helium balloons.</FONT></FONT></P>

<P><FONT COLOR="#FFFF00"><FONT SIZE=-1>It is the contention of The Tri-State
Advocates for Scientific Knowledge that the previous events in Middletown
on July 3, 4 and 5 are as explainable as the event on July 11, which is
obviously found to be a hoax. The determination that the previous sightings
have also been hoaxed is derived from the description and behavior of the
observed object in comparison with the explainable event of July 11.</FONT></FONT></P>

<P><FONT COLOR="#FFFF00"><FONT SIZE=-1>Strangely, it must also be noted
that during the July 3 through 8 time period, numerous UFO reports were
generated from various parts of Ohio. These reports came in from Urbana,
Ohio on July 3 and 8. A cone-shaped object was videotaped on Saturday,
July 6 along the Ohio-Indiana border, south of the Paulding, Ohio area
where a large crop-circle was discovered. The crop-circle was presumed
by some to also be a man-made hoax, but the culprits have not come forward
to claim responsibility. </FONT></FONT></P>

<P><FONT COLOR="#FFFF00"><FONT SIZE=-1>Although the persons or organizations
responsible for the deed in the Middletown area remains unknown, they should
be advised that their actions could precipitate a potential fire hazard
that could harm property or persons. In addition, a wide range of criminal
charges could be rendered against these frauds, including inducing panic.</FONT></FONT></P>

<P><FONT COLOR="#FFFF00"><FONT SIZE=-1>The Middletown Police Department,
including Lieutenant Schwarber and Major Hoffman, should be highly recognized
for their openness and professionalism in working with both T.A.S.K. and
the news media during the unexplainable phase of the investigations.</FONT></FONT></P>

<P><FONT COLOR="#FFFF00"><FONT SIZE=-1>The multiple hoaxes, taking place
in the Ohio area (in conjunction with unsolved reports from other Ohio
localities) suggests a series of events that may be larger in scope than
previously thought.</FONT></FONT></P>

<P><FONT COLOR="#FFFF00"><FONT SIZE=-1>What organization is capable of
executing a complex hoax of such magnitude during the same time frame from
diverse localities, and what is the purpose of the ruse? Is there a connection
with the highly publicized motion picture Independence Day?</FONT></FONT></P>

<P><FONT COLOR="#FFFF00"><FONT SIZE=-1>The T.A.S.K. organization, which
holds that many UFO reports are unexplainable, will continue to track and
investigate alleged UFO events in the Southern Ohio area with the singular
objective of studying and explaining, when possible, the purported events
for the purposes of scientific assessment.</FONT></FONT></P>
