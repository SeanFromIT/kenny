DonaldR. Berger. The first sighting took place during "The Jitney Carnival" of1949 and witnessed by hundreds The following morning, three local newspapers-The Cincinnati Post, The Cincinnati Enquirer and The Cincinnati Times Star-all had articles regarding 'strange lights' and 'comets seen over the city'from the previous evening.</i><p><i>There was an explanation for the occurrence, according to one localnewspaper. The Albee Theater in nearby Cincinnati, accompanied by the Ss.Peter &amp; Paul Church in Norwood, were operating searchlights. It wassaid that the hundreds of persons calling newspapers and weather bureauofficials were simply observing these searchlight beams 'bouncing off ofclouds.'</i><p><i>Despite this, the sightings began in earnest after 11:00 p.m. (Bergerlogs indicate that he observed the UFO from 8:15 p.m. to 11:00 p.m.) andcontinued to flummox Cincinnati residents until 6:30 a.m. the followingmorning. It seems unlikely searchlights would be operating all night longuntil daylight, and further still, one weather bureau official recountedhis early-morning observation of two objects that looked like "two weatherceiling balloons" that weren't moving despite a wind speed of 25 to 32-milesper hour.</i><p><i>Even the Berger logs indicate the possible presence of a second searchlightfrom that evening, whether Berger knew there was another searchlight atwork or not. "When I moved the searchlight away, the object continued toglow," Berger wrote in his 1949 logs that were later kept in the possessionof Rev. Gregory Miller until 1954, when he imparted them to UFO investigatorLeonard Stringfield.</i><p><i>Meanwhile, during the festival in Norwood, Robert Linn, the managingeditor of the Cincinnati Post, along with church pastor Rev. Gregory Miller,were certain that Berger's searchlight had found and been bouncing offof "some definite object." They entered into agreement and reported thesituation to intelligence officials at Wright Field in nearby Dayton, Ohio.</i><p><i>Now that the situation is established, I am hoping someone mightbe able to offer some explanation of the attitudes toward UFO investigationby Grudge during the August, 1949 time period. Was Project Grudge headquartedat Dayton and did they disregard the events at Norwood? The August 19thepisode is a mass-witness case, reported in all three local newspapersof Cincinnati, Ohio, a city not far south of Dayton, home of the airbase.A possible explanation is publicly toyed with: the deception caused bytwo searchlight beams strolling the dark skies. It seems as if Grudge folkswould have likely been aware of the events at Norwood on August 19, 1949- either from all the reportage or from the direct report to the airbaseitself, by Robert Linn and Rev. Miller. Why does the Norwood Case not factorin to their investigation when, in fact, far 'lesser' cases may have beenprominently addressed? If Project Grudge had sought to dismiss UFO sightingsas psychological phenomena, they had a good case with the Norwood searchlightevents at this stage of the situation.</i><p><i>Thanks</i><br><i>Kenny Young</i></blockquote><p><br><hr WIDTH="100%"><center><b><font face="Arial,Helvetica"><font color="#000000"><font size=-1>DOYOU HAVE ANY INFORMATION ABOUT THE 1949 NORWOOD UFO CASE?
