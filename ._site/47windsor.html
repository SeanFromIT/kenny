Hopes of collecting $3,000 reward from three cities � Chicago, Los Angeles
and Spokane � which offered $1,000 each for anyone �getting his hands on
a flying disc,� were built up and then shattered for many Windsorites this
morning. About 2,000 discs �actually pie plates- were thrown from two airplanes
hired by The Star which wanted to know Windsor�s reaction to an invasion
of �flying saucers.� Top photo shows an aerial view of one airplane dumping
discs over the city. Star Staff Photographer Jack Dalgleish snapped the
shot from the other airplane. Lower left shows two Star carrier boys who
had dreams of collecting a reward shattered when they found out the disc
they are holding was made of cardboard. Left is Stanley Fields, 13, of
1290 Oullette Avenue, and right, Jerry Murphy, 11, of 2287 Dougall Avenue.
Centre shows some of the discs as they floated to earth. Right is Artist
Fred Black�s conception of a flying saucer which was allegedly seen Sunday
night by Mrs. E. R. Myers of 419 Caroline Street.<font size=+1></font>
