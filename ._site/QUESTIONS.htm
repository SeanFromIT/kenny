<P><FONT COLOR="#FFFF00"><FONT SIZE=+3>Q</FONT><FONT SIZE=+1>UESTIONS </FONT><B>about
the FLARE THEORY</B></FONT> </P>

<P><FONT COLOR="#FFFF00"><FONT SIZE=-1>Numerous questions come to mind
about the October 16th, March 12 and March 26th happenings in Southern
Ohio, such as:</FONT></FONT></P>

<UL>
<P><FONT COLOR="#FFFF00"><FONT SIZE=-1>1. Why the sudden happenings worldwide?
There is no denying that portions of Tennessee, Arizona, Australia and
Canada have been subject unto the same sort of happenings, not to mention
the ongoing mass sightings in Mexico City of unusual aerial objects. How
many past reports of UFOs could be fall within this explanation? Are these
maneuvers performed across such a broad geographical scale that political
boundaries are of no consequence? Are these maneuvers masking some sort
of technological or psychological development being tested on a large scale
across these great distances?</FONT></FONT></P>

<P><FONT COLOR="#FFFF00"><FONT SIZE=-1>2. Clearly, the objective reader
must not be fooled into thinking these happenings are 'routine,' as was
indicated by the Air National Guard Sergeant from Springfield, Ohio, who
was previously interviewed. Hence the mass UFO SIGHTINGS reported from
Ohio and Arizona indicates the happening was anything BUT common. Routine
maneuvers involving flares would not engender the outrage which ensued,
as any 'routine' practices of this sort would be recognized by the general
populous. Atmospheric conditions would not be a factor, and the clarity
of the night would not be a significant factor that would enable a ground
observer to perceive the event any differently than normal or hazy weather
conditions. One witness added: &quot;if the sky had been cloudy, then these
things would have lit up the clouds.&quot;</FONT></FONT></P>

<P><FONT COLOR="#FFFF00"><FONT SIZE=-1>3. Military disregard for public
concern is obviously noted here. Why no advance notification? And in the
case of the October 16th and March 12th happenings from Ohio, why the police-like
militaristic hardship from Wright-Patterson Air Force Base to T.A.S.K.
investigators when such basic and routine questions were posed? More importantly,
why wouldn't they advance the same explanation for this activity as did
Springfield Air National Guard, when it would have been so easy to just
do so? Such behavior on the part of these hirelings engenders serious questions
about the accountability of these powerful, unstoppable federal agencies,
who seek to embroil sincere truth-seekers into a game of bureaucratic tomfoolery
to get at basic answers. <I>T.A.S.K. Investigations Coordinator RON SCHAFFNER
has filed a formal letter of complaint with Congressman Rob Portman of
Ohio regarding this curious behavior, and the efforts of these hirelings
to derail our quest for the truth.</I></FONT></FONT></P>

<P><FONT COLOR="#FFFF00"><FONT SIZE=-1>4. Why over a residential neighborhood?
This is a fundamental and basic question that cannot be ignored, as life
and property could be in jeopardy due numbers of reasons such as:</FONT></FONT></P>

<LI><FONT COLOR="#FFFF00"><FONT SIZE=-1><B>FIRE </B>from a falling flare
(remember, witnesses said these planes were so low that MISSILES could
be seen on the underside, and the objects were so near to the ground that
the size estimate of one particular object was as big as a dime held at
arms length), </FONT></FONT></LI>

<LI><FONT COLOR="#FFFF00"><FONT SIZE=-1><B>COLLISION </B>or<B> AIRCRAFT
CRASH</B> into the populated neighborhoods remains a frightening possibility
when extreme maneuvers of this sort, as was described by witnesses, are
taking place, and </FONT></FONT></LI>

<LI><FONT COLOR="#FFFF00"><FONT SIZE=-1><B>GENERAL ALARM </B>(i.e., fear.panic),
which includes the potential for traffic accidents due to traffic disruption
(as did happen on March 26), and also concerns for the elderly and other
certain persons who would deal with emotional consternation after observing
this peculiar, unannounced event. </FONT></FONT></LI>

<P><FONT COLOR="#FFFF00"><FONT SIZE=-1>5. Where is the outrage of the news
media? Clearly, the Cincinnati news media has demonstrated an undeniable
hostility toward the UFO subject matter by not advising the public of the
event, or of its explanation. The Arizona media, to the contrary, has dealt
the people of that region an honest assessment of their situation. </FONT></FONT></P>

<P><FONT COLOR="#FFFF00"><FONT SIZE=-1>Certain news organizations in Cincinnati,
namely <B>The Cincinnati Enquirer</B> and <B>WKRC Channel 12 News</B>,
had access to these developments, both being informed by the citizenry
prior to our investigations. Neither agency advised the public of the event,
nor did they advise them of our conclusive findings, despite a FAX PRESS
RELEASE announcement to 12 separate news media outlets in the Cincinnati
vicinity on March 27th. <I>In the days after the event, the HEAVENS GATE
suicides engendered mass reportage, however, as was the national trend.
</I>Where is the <B>objective analysis</B> and reportage of these real
and true events happening in Southern Ohio to the thousands of concerned
witnesses who still remain unaware of the possible explanations? In the
case of the March 26, 1997 UFO sightings in Ohio, persons in these agencies
who are responsible for bringing the details of this event to the public
have demonstrated a certain disregard for basic reportage that should be
troubling to the objective reader.</FONT></FONT></P>

<P><B><FONT COLOR="#FFFF00">Complications with the FLARE THEORY:</FONT></B></P>

<P><FONT COLOR="#FFFF00"><FONT SIZE=-1>This writer has been inundated with
numerous letters of inquiry and serious concern regarding the explanations
offered to account for the October 16th and March 26th events. Some have
stingingly charged that eyewitness testimony and detail have been disregarded,
information of which would not conform to the FLARE THEORY.</FONT></FONT></P>

<P><FONT COLOR="#FFFF00"><FONT SIZE=-1>This is not true, as T.A.S.K. is
seeking to completely address all aspects of the reported phenomenon, and
apply - if possible - a rational explanation to the events in question.
T.A.S.K. will openly acknowledge that many claims made by several witnesses
to the October 16th and March 26th events in Ohio are not compatible with
the FLARE THEORY explanation, but this is where further investigations
are ongoing.</FONT></FONT></P>

<P><FONT COLOR="#FFFF00"><FONT SIZE=-1>It is also important for the reader
to keep in mind that many witnesses have been advised of our findings,
and are comfortable and satisfied that the FLARE THEORY explanation is
an adequate answer that can be applied to resolve the mystery.</FONT></FONT></P>

<P><FONT COLOR="#FFFF00"><FONT SIZE=-1>Those who take exception to our
findings are given extra attention, and we will seek to completely address
every possible detail the witnesses can furnish that may enlighten us as
to the full scope and exact nature of the happenings in question.</FONT></FONT></P>
