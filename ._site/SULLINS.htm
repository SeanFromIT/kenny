<P><FONT COLOR="#FFFF00"><FONT SIZE=-1>On Tuesday, August 5, 1997, Capt.
Drew Sullins, of the Maryland Air National Guard was interviewed by Kenny
Young regarding the March 13th Arizona UFO reports. </FONT></FONT></P>

<P><FONT COLOR="#FFFF00"><FONT SIZE=-1><B>YOUNG:</B> Thanks for taking
time from your busy schedule to talk this afternoon about Project Snowbird
and the flare droppings over Arizona that generated some attention. One
of the things I want to discuss is the TIME DELAY in announcing the explanation
for this event, which was a duration of almost 4 to 5 months. Is there
any reason to your knowledge for this delay?</FONT></FONT></P>

<P><FONT COLOR="#FFFF00"><FONT SIZE=-1><B>SULLINS: </B>Yes there is, and
I don't think people are going to believe it, but it's the truth... it's
a simple miscommunication. Apparently when the military in Phoenix was
first approached, they looked at their flight logs, which are kept in two
separate categories called &quot;RESIDENT&quot; and &quot;VISITING&quot;
logs. These logs chart all of the incoming or outgoing air traffic. When
the first inquiries of this went out, DAVIS-MONTHAN didn't check the visiting
flight logs. The Public Affairs Officer down there called the people at
operations who kept the flight logs, and they said, &quot;we didn't have
anything up that day.&quot; After several months, Captain Eileen Bienz
was told by someone, and I can't remember who, that there was a project
called Snowbird, which was an Air National Guard 'Op.' Bienz didn't have
information on Snowbird, because Arizona units don't participate in it.
Snowbird is an operation run during the winter when they take A.N.G. units
located in the northern U.S. When it snows and the weather gets bad, they
fly their units out there for a couple of weeks and train during the winter
because the weather for flying is so good. Bienz put two and two together
and checked the visiting flight logs, and sure enough it was discovered
that there was an Air National Guard unit flying around.</FONT></FONT></P>

<P><FONT COLOR="#FFFF00"><FONT SIZE=-1>YOUNG: So the miscommunication was
due to Davis-Monthan?</FONT></FONT></P>

<P><FONT COLOR="#FFFF00"><FONT SIZE=-1>SULLINS: Yeah, it wasn't on my part.
Captain Bienz called me up and told me the whole story, just a couple of
weeks ago and first I ever heard of it, and said, 'now can you confirm
these things?' So I called our Ops guys of the 175th Wing &amp; 104th Fighter
Squadron, and they were able to confirm for me that they were flying that
night in that area and dropping flares. The information was not held, as
soon as we got it together it was released.</FONT></FONT></P>

<P><FONT COLOR="#FFFF00"><FONT SIZE=-1>YOUNG: Why had the pilots in this
unit, knowing they did this, not come forth in the hours after the publicity
to announce the proper explanation?</FONT></FONT></P>

<P><FONT COLOR="#FFFF00"><FONT SIZE=-1>SULLINS: First of all, the deployment
for the unit was on the last day of a 15-day training mission happening
during the first 2-weeks of March. It was one of the last missions they
flew out there, and by the time it hit the news, they might have been gone.
The story wasn't the big news event in Baltimore that it was in Phoenix.
I think they seemed genuinely suprised that they were the cause of all
the hub-bub.</FONT></FONT></P>

<P><FONT COLOR="#FFFF00"><FONT SIZE=-1>YOUNG: When you say they were 'gone,'
what do you mean by that?</FONT></FONT></P>

<P><FONT COLOR="#FFFF00"><FONT SIZE=-1>SULLINS: They came back to Maryland.
It was a 2-week training mission. They were there the first 2-weeks in
March, and so by March 13th, that night, they landed and probably got up
on March 14th or 15th and rolled out of there.</FONT></FONT></P>

<P><FONT COLOR="#FFFF00"><FONT SIZE=-1>YOUNG: There was plenty of national
media exposure regarding this, and also a second-wave of publicity in mid-June
following the USA TODAY article. Is there any reason these pilots or affiliates
with the squadron would not have come forth with this explanation in spite
of all this?</FONT></FONT></P>

<P><FONT COLOR="#FFFF00"><FONT SIZE=-1>SULLINS: Well I honestly don't think
that they knew. I really don't. The lead pilot that night, a Lieutenant
Colonel by the name of Ron Henry, was retiring about that time... he's
retired now and commuting back and forth to Minneapolis and he's really
busy. He's in the flight training program for Northwest Airlines learning
how to fly a DC-9, and all these guys are really busy. They're citizen
airmen and citizen soldiers, so they have full-time jobs and careers, families
and other things they have to manage. Look, I'll be honest with you, until
Captain Bienz called me up, I honestly had not even heard about this. I
read two papers in the morning, one of them on the internet, one in my
office, and so if I could miss it, then I guess they could too.</FONT></FONT></P>

<P><FONT COLOR="#FFFF00"><FONT SIZE=-1>YOUNG: Was the lead pilot and others
involved aware that dropping these flares would produce the results among
the population below that it did?</FONT></FONT></P>

<P><FONT COLOR="#FFFF00"><FONT SIZE=-1>SULLINS: No, I don't think they
would have known because it's a standard routine training mission out there.
Flares are dropped alot on that range. On that particular night, the visibility
and atmospheric conditions were such that the things could have been viewed
from the southwestern suburbs of Phoenix. These flares can be seen from
hundreds of miles if the weather conditions are right. Apparently, they're
not the only unit out there that dropped flares. Who's to say, perhaps
the weather conditions and everything just kind of came together and these
things could be seen from Phoenix.</FONT></FONT></P>

<P><FONT COLOR="#FFFF00"><FONT SIZE=-1>YOUNG: You speculate that other
units could have also been involved?</FONT></FONT></P>

<P><FONT COLOR="#FFFF00"><FONT SIZE=-1>SULLINS: The only units we had flying
that night were the eight aircraft from the 104th Fighter Squadron.</FONT></FONT></P>

<P><FONT COLOR="#FFFF00"><FONT SIZE=-1>YOUNG: What about the arguments
that the flares were visible longer than 1-hour, when the actual burn-time
for parachute flares would be around 4 or 5 minutes?</FONT></FONT></P>

<P><FONT COLOR="#FFFF00"><FONT SIZE=-1>SULLINS: They were dropping alot
of flares. They were over that range for over an hour. One aircraft would
go in, drop a couple of flares, make its run and attack a target, then
another aircraft would come in from behind and illuminate the range again,
so they were continually dropping flares in that area.</FONT></FONT></P>

<P><FONT COLOR="#FFFF00"><FONT SIZE=-1>YOUNG: So the pilots could see the
flares from their plane?</FONT></FONT></P>

<P><FONT COLOR="#FFFF00"><FONT SIZE=-1>SULLINS: Oh yes.</FONT></FONT></P>

<P><FONT COLOR="#FFFF00"><FONT SIZE=-1>YOUNG: Would they have been able
to visualize that this could be something the population below would notice
as well?</FONT></FONT></P>

<P><FONT COLOR="#FFFF00"><FONT SIZE=-1>SULLINS: I can't speak for the pilots
because I wasn't flying, but the dropping of flares out there is so routine
that I don't see why they would've had any cause for alarm.</FONT></FONT></P>

<P><FONT COLOR="#FFFF00"><FONT SIZE=-1>YOUNG: Again, the delay in this
announcement is somewhat odd. How many men would have been involved with
the 104th Fighter Squadron that would have had knowledge of this operation?</FONT></FONT></P>

<P><FONT COLOR="#FFFF00"><FONT SIZE=-1>SULLINS: There were eight aircraft.
Eight pilots.</FONT></FONT></P>

<P><FONT COLOR="#FFFF00"><FONT SIZE=-1>YOUNG: Were there also officers
loading the flares in pods under the wings who would have had knowledge
of this?</FONT></FONT></P>

<P><FONT COLOR="#FFFF00"><FONT SIZE=-1>SULLINS: I'd have to call the squadron
on that, but once Davis- Monthan checked the visiting flight logs, they
were able to explain it. The base knew about it, but they just didn't check
the visiting flight logs.</FONT></FONT></P>

<P><FONT COLOR="#FFFF00"><FONT SIZE=-1>YOUNG: How would this activity have
been specified or listed on a flight log?</FONT></FONT></P>

<P><FONT COLOR="#FFFF00"><FONT SIZE=-1>SULLINS: That's a good question.
I don't have an answer to that one.</FONT></FONT></P>

<P><FONT COLOR="#FFFF00"><FONT SIZE=-1>YOUNG: Do they list flare exercises
in flight logs?</FONT></FONT></P>

<P><FONT COLOR="#FFFF00"><FONT SIZE=-1>SULLINS: Anytime you're flying at
night in the A-10 Thunderbolt on a night training exercise, it's probable
that you'll always be dropping flares. It's very routine, there's ABSOLUTELY
NOTHING OUT OF THE ORDINARY about what they did out there.</FONT></FONT></P>

<P><FONT COLOR="#FFFF00"><FONT SIZE=-1>YOUNG: It was obviously extraordinary
in light of the public reaction to the operation.</FONT></FONT></P>

<P><FONT COLOR="#FFFF00"><FONT SIZE=-1>SULLINS: Well that was, but not
the mission itself.</FONT></FONT></P>

<P><FONT COLOR="#FFFF00"><FONT SIZE=-1>YOUNG: Do they announce flare exercises
in advance so as not to cause public alarm?</FONT></FONT></P>

<P><FONT COLOR="#FFFF00"><FONT SIZE=-1>SULLINS: No.</FONT></FONT></P>

<P><FONT COLOR="#FFFF00"><FONT SIZE=-1>YOUNG: They do not?</FONT></FONT></P>

<P><FONT COLOR="#FFFF00"><FONT SIZE=-1>SULLINS: No, they never have before.
It's never produced this public response before and our pilots have flown
this same mission out of that range a number of times before, and done
so without so much as raising an eyebrow.</FONT></FONT></P>

<P><FONT COLOR="#FFFF00"><FONT SIZE=-1>YOUNG: Would all the reports of
a triangular object, mentioned in the USA Today article, be attributable
to the flare droppings?</FONT></FONT></P>

<P><FONT COLOR="#FFFF00"><FONT SIZE=-1>SULLINS: I don't know. I've only
seen videotapes twice, and they looked like flares to me.</FONT></FONT></P>

<P><FONT COLOR="#FFFF00"><FONT SIZE=-1>YOUNG: I recalled that some of the
early reports on this that some Air Tower Operators were looking at these
flares and at the same time detected no radar track of any aircraft on
radar. Could you please tell me if eight A-10's which were dropping flares
would have any Stealth capabilities which would have caused them not to
be detected by radar?</FONT></FONT></P>

<P><FONT COLOR="#FFFF00"><FONT SIZE=-1>SULLINS: Nope, and the pilots told
me that they had everything operating that night and that they should've
shown up on radar. Sky Harbor International Airport held radar surveillance
for this area, and I don't want to speak for them, and don't know what
their coverage area is, but I understand that the area is restricted military
airspace. Sky Harbor International Airport will have to answer for those
questions. The A-10's do not have any Stealth technology on it, and they
were flying with all of their navigation radar systems and everything operating.</FONT></FONT></P>

<P><FONT COLOR="#FFFF00"><FONT SIZE=-1>YOUNG: Since we had some alarm and
concern generated from the public over the March 13 flare droppings, would
it be possible to duplicate an identical event for the public, and arrange
for the media to be present to document the event?</FONT></FONT></P>

<P><FONT COLOR="#FFFF00"><FONT SIZE=-1>SULLINS: As the pilots explained
it to me, it may have been the atmospheric conditions that night which
allowed this thing to be seen so far away in Phoenix, but I'm not so sure
we could replicate or duplicate the exact conditions that night. But secondly,
it costs a hell of a lot of money to fly these planes for an hour, and
I don't know that the United States Air Force would authorize that expenditure.
I'd be willing to bet that since this has happened, a whole bunch of flares
have dropped over that range since then.</FONT></FONT></P>

<P><FONT COLOR="#FFFF00"><FONT SIZE=-1>YOUNG: So a repeat performance to
satisfy the populace would not be possible?</FONT></FONT></P>

<P><FONT COLOR="#FFFF00"><FONT SIZE=-1>SULLINS: I'm not saying it's not
possible, I'm just saying that I'm the wrong guy to ask. You're not going
to get the Maryland Air National Guard to fly all the way across the country
to replicate the event. That's a request that'll have to be made to the
United States Air Force in the Pentagon, and that would then be handed
down to the National Guard Bureau, and it goes from echelon to echelon,
through the bureaucratic process. Davis- Monthan could assist there, if
one were to inquire when the next training mission would be scheduled over
Luke AFB where A-10s will be dropping flares from between 10 and 15 thousand
feet. That is essentially all you have to replicate. The thing that people
are getting all bent out of shape about is the fact that I never offered
this as the 'definitive explanation' for what happened. We only offered
this up because an inquiry was made to the military regarding unidentified
lights. We released all the information on our operation, but we are not
prepared to say definitively that these are, in fact, the lights. I'm not
trying to stir anything up here, but I can only say that our unit was there,
we flew these missions, we dropped these flares. Alot of people think it's
flares. Some of the pilots who've looked at the videos flat out said it
was flares. According to what every military expert and A-10 pilot told
me leads me to believe it was flares.</FONT></FONT></P>

<P><FONT COLOR="#FFFF00"><FONT SIZE=-1>YOUNG: Since another demonstration
would be difficult, would it be possible to notify the public in the event
of future exersizes of this nature?</FONT></FONT></P>

<P><FONT COLOR="#FFFF00"><FONT SIZE=-1>SULLINS: Look, I gotta be completely
candid here, we're not going to pick up the phone every darn time we do
something. Military operations are just that - military operations. They're
not things that the public is used to seeing on an everyday basis, and
if everytime we conducted something that we thought the general public
would find unusual, I'd spend my whole life on the phone telling people
about our training. And in Maryland, we don't drop flares. And the reason
we dropped so many flares in Tucson is because its one of the few places
we can go to execute that mission. There is no place in Maryland that we
could drop these flares safely. The Warfield A.N.G. base outside of Baltimore
is not properly equipped to load, handle and store these type of flares
and other ordinances. When we go to Arizona, we fly lots of these missions,
and try to maximize our time out there because we can't do it at home.
So we don't have any need to call people here at home and tell them our
plans.</FONT></FONT></P>

<P><FONT COLOR="#FFFF00"><FONT SIZE=-1>YOUNG: If it were ever deemed needful
to announce anything, who would be contacted?</FONT></FONT></P>

<P><FONT COLOR="#FFFF00"><FONT SIZE=-1>SULLINS: I would put out the release.
If my boss came to me and said that we were going to be conducting an exersize
that would alarm the general public, then I would put out a news release
to the TV, radio and newspapers.</FONT></FONT></P>

<P><FONT COLOR="#FFFF00"><FONT SIZE=-1>YOUNG: Do you also handle NOTAM
(Notice To Airmen) reports or advisories to other airports or pilots in
the area of exersizes?</FONT></FONT></P>

<P><FONT COLOR="#FFFF00"><FONT SIZE=-1>SULLINS: I don't know what a NOTAM
report is, I've never heard of one here.</FONT></FONT></P>

<P><FONT COLOR="#FFFF00"><FONT SIZE=-1>YOUNG: I do appreciate your time
and detailed information today.</FONT></FONT></P>

<P><FONT COLOR="#FFFF00"><FONT SIZE=-1>SULLINS: My pleasure. </FONT></FONT></P>

<P><B><FONT COLOR="#00FFFF">COMMENT:</FONT></B></P>
</UL>

<UL>
<P><B><FONT COLOR="#00FFFF">It was obvious that Capt. Sullins was knowledgeable
about the flight operations of the Maryland A.N.G. and familiar with the
flare maneuvers. He had clearly handled several of these questions previously,
and had also indicated that he interviewed several of the pilots involved.
He may have been briefed on how to handle these inquiries, as much of what
he said was strikingly similar to comments made to me by a captain from
the 178th Fighter Group and 162nd Fighter Squadron Flying Unit Fighter
Operations division from Springfield Air National Guard base after a separate
but identical incident happened in Southern Ohio on March 26. I found Sullins
to be courteous and very professional.</FONT></B></P>
</UL>

<UL>
<P><B><FONT COLOR="#00FFFF">However, I am uncomfortable by the fact that
the pilots of the eight aircraft responsible, or the other airman involved
in the unit operations of the 175th Wing &amp; 104th Fighter Squadron,
would supposedly have 'not heard' of the March 13th debacle involving UFOs
over Arizona. I cannot fathom that these persons would not &quot;do the
right thing&quot; and put the matter to rest as abruptly as possible.</FONT></B></P>
</UL>

<UL>
<P><B><FONT COLOR="#00FFFF">Recall that Snowbird remained in Arizona at
least the following afternoon, or possibly several days after the March
13th event, giving them plenty of opportunities to hear of the UFO reports
which had saturated the Arizona media.</FONT></B></P>
</UL>

<UL>
<P><B><FONT COLOR="#00FFFF">Furthermore, Sullins seemed befuddled by the
lack of radar returns for the A-10 activity from Sky Harbor International
Airport. He also didn't elect to address the reports of a triangular object
supposedly observed, and dismissed the public reaction of a 'routine' exersize
to weather conditions, an identical scenario first advanced to me by an
officer with the Springfiled, Ohio A.N.G. after the investigation of the
Ohio disturbance on March 26.</FONT></B></P>
</UL>

<UL>
<P><B><FONT COLOR="#00FFFF">In an honest assessment of this drama, I must
observe that the Arizona scenario is highly suspicious and all-too-similar
to the March 26th Ohio happening. And due to the delayed confession from
the Maryland Air National Guard, one must seriously consider if an ulterior
motive may be at work in this travesty.</FONT></B></P>
</UL>

<UL>
<P><B><FONT COLOR="#00FFFF">The Ohio event dealt also with a large, triangular
object traveling overhead, and also a 'bouncing' object that was witnessed
by a fire and E.M.S. coordinator from New Vienna, Ohio. The Arizona flare
explanation, like the Ohio story, is complicated by nagging inconsistencies
that come against the flare explanation.</FONT></B></P>
</UL>

<UL>
<P><B><FONT COLOR="#00FFFF">I am satisfied that flares were there, but
if the other reports are to honestly considered, then we only have a partial
resolution to this very interesting mystery. </FONT></B></P>
