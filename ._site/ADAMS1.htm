ADAMS COUNTY MYSTERY <BR>
</FONT><FONT SIZE=-1>and the case of the MISSING FOIA's</FONT></FONT> 
<P><FONT COLOR="#FFFF00"><FONT SIZE=-1>On October 16, 1996, many police
departments from a massive area of Southern Ohio were notified by dozens
of citizen advisement's reporting an <I>unknown aerial phenomenon</I> in
the evening skies. The reports were generated from as far south as Maysville,
Kentucky to as far north as Chillicothe, Ohio, describing red, flare like
objects that would 'appear and disappear,' and sometimes 'travel in formations.'
The incident came on the heels of a series of similar incidents happening
in the weeks prior over Scioto County, Ohio, at the Apple Orchard Festival
happening near Jackson, Ohio.</FONT></FONT></P>

<UL>
<LI><FONT COLOR="#FFFF00"><FONT SIZE=-1>VIDEOTAPE</FONT></FONT></LI>
</UL>

<P><FONT COLOR="#FFFF00"><FONT SIZE=-1>The October 16th disturbance was
documented on videotape from a Waverly, Ohio resident, and the tape has
generated extensive national media interest, and prompted reportage on
the syndicated TV program SIGHTINGS, where it is being subjected to extensive
computer analysis by MUFON's Staff Photoanalyst, Jeff Sainio. As of this
writing, his analysis of the videotape is still pending.</FONT></FONT></P>

<P><FONT COLOR="#FFFF00"><FONT SIZE=-1>Kenny Young of the Cincinnati-based
Tri-State Advocates for Scientific Knowledge research organization has
consulted with JOE ROZZI of Rozzi's Famous Fireworks, one of the largest
fireworks distributors in the Midwestern United States, and he asserted
that the flare-like images seen on the videotape may be attributable to
'military flare testing' of STARBURST FLARES, which are used to divert
incoming heat-seeking missiles. Although the images on the video do not
appear to descend as normal flares would, Joe Rozzi asserted that this
is a misleading feature of the recording blamed largely upon the angle
of observation.</FONT></FONT></P>

<P><FONT COLOR="#FFFF00"><FONT SIZE=-1>This contention was also separately
made by an Air Force Combat Veteran fighter pilot, who viewed the recording
for additional consultation purposes. The pilot served his country in Vietnam,
and has combat experience. He also held that the witnesses were categorically
wrong in their assertions that abnormal or extraordinary ballistic behavior
would have been noted in the flight or performance conduct of the flare-like
objects. The pilot stated that the videotape depicts a flare chain being
dispensed from a moving target, possibly for infrared experimentation.
His assertion was based upon the following observed traits:</FONT></FONT></P>

<UL>
<P><FONT COLOR="#FFFF00"><FONT SIZE=-1>1. 'Twinkling' effect in burn-out
</FONT></FONT></P>

<P><FONT COLOR="#FFFF00"><FONT SIZE=-1>2. Rate of being dispensed (or ejected)
from aircraft </FONT></FONT></P>

<P><FONT COLOR="#FFFF00"><FONT SIZE=-1>3. Distance apart </FONT></FONT></P>

<P><FONT COLOR="#FFFF00"><FONT SIZE=-1>4. Indicative of being ejected from
a moving object </FONT></FONT></P>
</UL>

<P><FONT COLOR="#FFFF00"><FONT SIZE=-1>The performance behavior in question,
which is not compatible with this theory, is the frustrated observations
and testimonies of multiple witnesses... including the videographer...
who claimed that the flare like objects would 'REVERT BACK' into an alleged
PRIMARY OBJECT. </FONT></FONT></P>

</TABLE></CENTER>

</TABLE>

<UL>
<P><FONT COLOR="#FFFF00"><FONT SIZE=+1>Described performance characteristics
<BR>
conflicting with the flare theory</FONT></FONT></P>

<P><FONT COLOR="#FFFF00"><FONT SIZE=-1>One witness stated, &quot;I know
helicopters couldn't do this because they would crash when they would come
back together like that.&quot; </FONT></FONT></P>

<P><FONT COLOR="#FFFF00"><FONT SIZE=-1>Another witness declared that the
objects ZAPPED back together after 'blossoming' out. This ballistic conduct
is regrettably not captured on the Ross County video, which recorded only
a few seconds of the aerial abnormality.</FONT></FONT></P>

<P><FONT COLOR="#FFFF00"><FONT SIZE=-1>The sightings have been triangulated
to have occurred at a 29,000 foot elevation in a restricted military air
corridor above Adams County, which is the location of a GE/Martin Marietta
testing complex situated within the Peach Mountain range. Coincidentally,
this is the same locality of the F-16D ANG fighter jet crash on November
27, 1996, in which two pilots ejected to safety.</FONT></FONT></P>

<P><B><FONT COLOR="#FFFF00"><FONT SIZE=+1>Official Inquiries</FONT></FONT></B></P>

<P><FONT COLOR="#FFFF00"><FONT SIZE=-1>In the days after researchers acquired
the videotape, several written appeals were sent to WRIGHT- PATTERSON AIR
FORCE BASE, the DEA and the FAA GREAT LAKES OPERATION requesting clarification
about pilot sightings and potential military flare testing on October 16th.
</FONT></FONT><IMG SRC="Oct16b.jpg" HEIGHT=163 WIDTH=312 ALIGN=RIGHT></P>

<P><FONT COLOR="#FFFF00"><FONT SIZE=-1>However, the initial request for
information was strangely lost at the Wright-Pat public affairs office.
A second request for assistance was bitterly addressed by Lt. Col. Marc
S. Martens, who would not comment on the Oct. 16th incident which generated
public alarm, and furthermore would not assist to any degree in the investigation.
These individuals greeted our investigations with a militaristic, no-comment
mentality, when we sought to apply a basic, conventional explanation to
the matter.</FONT></FONT></P>

<P><FONT COLOR="#FFFF00"><FONT SIZE=-1>When asked directly if flares had
been used over the region on the date in question for training or testing
purposes, Martens was notably evasive and eluded a direct response.</FONT></FONT></P>

<P><FONT COLOR="#FFFF00"><FONT SIZE=-1>Of course we are greatly disappointed
at the lack of assistance advanced by this public agency and their hirelings,
and we are hopeful that this unfortunate and unaccountable behavior will
not continue in the future.</FONT></FONT></P>

<P><FONT COLOR="#FFFF00"><FONT SIZE=-1>Regarding the possibilities of flare
testing in the region, Martens responded by stating 'we advertise all of
our maneuvers in the newspapers in advance of any exercises.' When asked
if any exercises were in progress which would have engendered the reports,
Martens tactfully eluded the question by stating: "Any public concerns
of such phenomenon are to be handled by local police agencies. Have you
got it?"</FONT></FONT></P>

<P><FONT COLOR="#FFFF00"><FONT SIZE=-1>As a result of this abnormal behavior,
T.A.S.K. investigations coordinator RON SCHAFFNER has formulated a letter
of complaint to Congressman Rob Portman, advising him of the situation.
</FONT></FONT></P>

<P><B><FONT COLOR="#FFFF00"><FONT SIZE=+1>Review</FONT></FONT></B></P>

<P><FONT COLOR="#FFFF00"><FONT SIZE=-1>Although we are satisfied that military
testing of flares in the restricted air corridor is a viable explanation
to apply which will solve the mystery of October 16th, this explanation
is not applicable without stating that many of the witnesses to the event
were WRONG in their perception of certain abnormal ballistic traits. This
is not due to any fault of their own, but rather, a sincere misunderstanding
of events taking place within a 3-dimensional environment and observed
from a certain, disadvantageous angle.</FONT></FONT></P>

<P><FONT COLOR="#FFFF00"><FONT SIZE=-1>Also reported prior to the October
16th event was a series of happenings in ROSS AND HIGHLAND COUNTIES, OHIO
in February of 1996. On Monday, February 5th at 1:30 AM, one observer spied
a line of large red balls, too many to count, reportedly extending across
40 degrees of the sky. More events in ROSS AND PIKE COUNTIES, OHIO happened
in APRIL and MAY of 1996 in which a sky full of strange red object alarmed
area residents, and another occurrence on May 22 from Hilliard, Ohio involving
a bizarre cluster of red-orange lights to the west. Also seen in conjunction
with these objects are reports of a silent, hovering aircraft that resembles
a B-2 STEALTH BOMBER.</FONT></FONT></P>

<P><FONT COLOR="#FFFF00"><FONT SIZE=-1>The October 16th event in Southern
Ohio also followed events in Rutherford County, Tennessee which was reported
on the CBS Evening News with Dan Rather. Police offices in several counties
and also in Hendersonville, Tennessee, received phone calls regarding this.
One witness from this area stated: &quot;The sky was dark except for this
bright light and a few little stars. Suddenly this cluster of lights started
forming to the right." This event was also videotaped, and information
regarding this may be obtained through Janet Sharpe of the Upper Cumberland
Mutual UFO Network.</FONT></FONT></P>

<P><FONT COLOR="#FFFF00"><FONT SIZE=-1>As of this date, the MUFON photoanalyst
JEFF SAINIO is known to have analyzed this recording by means of computer
analysis, but his findings are not available, and inquiries made to acquire
an update on his analysis have not been answered.</FONT></FONT></P>

<P><TT><FONT COLOR="#FF8000">FOIA OFFICE</FONT></TT></P>

<P><TT><FONT COLOR="#FF8000">THE enclosed FOIA PETITION from the TRI-STATE
ADVOCATES FOR SCIENTIFIC KNOWLEDGE research organization was delivered
by FAX TRANSMISSION on NOV. 3, 1996 to the following telephone FAX number:
(312) 694-7184. The FOIA request dealt with reported UFO sightings in Southern
Ohio. VERBAL CONFIRMATION of its reception was given by A FEMALE FOIA OFFICER
by the name of Ida. </FONT></TT></P>

<P><TT><FONT COLOR="#FF8000">THREE SUBSEQUENT PHONE CALLS were placed to
the PUBLIC AFFAIRS OFFICE in the months following, to INQUIRE ABOUT THE
STATUS OF THE PETITION. In each phone inquiry, the PUBLIC AFFAIRS OFFICER
(IDA AND VIOLET) assured that a TELEPHONE RESPONSE WOULD BE RETURNED 'LATER
THAT DAY' to ADVISE OF THE STATUS OF THE PETITION. </FONT></TT></P>

<P><TT><FONT COLOR="#FF8000">IN SPITE OF THIS ASSURANCE, NO TELEPHONE ADVISEMENTS
HAD BEEN ADVANCED.</FONT></TT></P>

<P><TT><FONT COLOR="#FF8000">On JANUARY 7, 1997, a TELEPHONE INQUIRY placed
to the FAA GREAT LAKES REGION FOIA OFFICE to inquire about the status of
the petition revealed that IT HAD STRANGELY BEEN 'LOST SOMEWHERE.' </FONT></TT></P>

<P><TT><FONT COLOR="#FF8000">In a telephone message, it was kindly advised
that the request be 'RE-SENT.'</FONT></TT></P>

<P><TT><FONT COLOR="#FF8000">A similar request regarding the same issue
was also forwarded to THE WRIGHT-PATTERSON AIR FORCE BASE FOIA OFFICE on
OCTOBER 29, 1996. Strangely, it was also dealt WITH THE SAME DEMISE, and
its re-transmission was finally recommended after a two-month delay. A
third similar FOIA request was also forwarded to the DRUG ENFORCEMENT AGENCY.
In spite of verbal confirmation of its reception and two follow-up phone
calls, no written acknowledgment that it is being handled has been advanced,
despite the law requiring such notifications within a 10-day time period.</FONT></TT></P>

<P><TT><FONT COLOR="#FF8000">As a serious investigative research organization
which analyzes reported unidentified flying objects, the delays in handling
these requests have HINDERED OUR INVESTIGATIONS. Furthermore, THE ABNORMAL
PHENOMENON OF THE 'MISSING' FOIA REQUESTS has now become A FACTOR IN THE
INVESTIGATIONS of the October 16th event. </FONT></TT></P>

<P><TT><FONT COLOR="#FF8000">IT IS HEREBY REQUESTED THAT AN INVESTIGATION
BE LAUNCHED INTO THIS MATTER. </FONT></TT></P>

<P><TT><FONT COLOR="#FF8000">It is well understood that the current POP-CULTURE
and FOLKLORE has IMPLICATED various beleaguered agencies such as the FAA
and USAF with WORKING AGAINST THE AMERICAN PEOPLE to HIDE THE TRUTH ABOUT
THE UFO SITUATION FROM THE PUBLIC. The sort of activities such as 'MISSING
FOIA REQUESTS' from these suspect agencies only serves to FAN THE FLAMES
OF SUCH SPECULATION.</FONT></TT></P>

<P><TT><FONT COLOR="#FF8000">IN ADDITION, LETTERS AND FAX TRANSMISSIONS
ARE NOW BEING PRODUCED WHICH WILL BE DELIVERED, IN RESPONSE TO THIS INCIDENT,
TO VARIOUS OTHER FEDERALLY APPOINTED AND ELECTED OFFICES, ADVISING THEM
OF OUR CONCERNS. </FONT></TT></P>

<P><TT><FONT COLOR="#FF8000">It is with regret that this request for an
investigation is made. Our research into an event which had caused great
public concern over a wide part of Southern Ohio, has been hindered, and
more importantly, it is worrisome that PUBLIC AGENCIES, owned by and accountable
TO THE PEOPLE, are either riddled by inept internal operating procedures
which result in such disorder, or functioning on the basis of some other
unknown motive to deny the release of valuable information from the public.</FONT></TT></P>

<P><FONT COLOR="#FFFF00"><FONT SIZE=-1>FOIA REQUEST</FONT></FONT></P>

<P><FONT COLOR="#FFFF00"><FONT SIZE=-1>Under the provisions of the FREEDOM
OF INFORMATION ACT, the following information is requested for disclosure:</FONT></FONT></P>

<P><FONT COLOR="#FFFF00"><FONT SIZE=-1>October 16, 1996: in the regions
of Adams, Scioto, Ross and Brown Counties of Ohio, many phone calls were
placed to numerous police dispatch offices by multiple persons reporting
an unknown aerial phenomenon. The reports were generated from as far south
as Maysville, Kentucky to as far north as Chillicothe, Ohio. The description
of the phenomenon is consistent among the witnesses, and the event has
been triangulated to have occurred at an altitude of 5.6757 miles, or 29,967
ft. over the Adams County region. A Ross County resident has recorded the
event on home video equipment, where dogs in the neighborhood were noted
as barking and behaving wildly for the duration of the occurrence. Dozens
of callers reported the sighting to a Chillicothe radio station, and a
Columbus news station ran the video shortly afterwards. The event was reported
in the Portsmouth Daily Times and The Cincinnati Post.</FONT></FONT></P>

<P><FONT COLOR="#FFFF00"><FONT SIZE=-1>In order to ascertain the explanation
for this occurrence, this FOIA Petition is being placed with FAA, GREAT
LAKES REGION headquarters for assistance in determining if any records
exist regarding pilot observations, - or radar confirmation, - and/or FAA
air tower notification or observation of the phenomenon. </FONT></FONT></P>

<P><FONT COLOR="#FFFF00"><FONT SIZE=-1>It is known that some of the sightings
occurred over a restricted air corridor, and also requested for disclosure
are any advisement's or records available regarding maneuvers or airborne
emergency flares being tested over the region on the date in question.</FONT></FONT></P>

<P><FONT COLOR="#FFFF00"><FONT SIZE=-1>Feel free to contact us for questions,
as we seek to lend our services and support to help resolve this situation.
Your assistance in our efforts is deeply appreciated. </FONT></FONT></P>
