<P><FONT FACE="ARIAL,HELVETICA"><FONT COLOR="#FFFF00"><FONT SIZE=-1>James

<P><FONT FACE="ARIAL,HELVETICA"><FONT COLOR="#FFFF00"><FONT SIZE=-1>Pressed
by reporters, Snodgrass said only that it was not connected with the atomic

<P><FONT FACE="ARIAL,HELVETICA"><FONT COLOR="#FFFF00"><FONT SIZE=-1>Asked
whether the weapon had any bearing on the casualties or a military problem
encountered on the island, Snodgrass replied tersely, &quot;Could be.&quot;</FONT></FONT></FONT></P>

<P><FONT FACE="ARIAL,HELVETICA"><FONT COLOR="#FFFF00"><FONT SIZE=-1>Snodgrass,
who lives at 150 Somerset Dr., College Hill, was a civilian when he was
assigned to a group of British and New Zealand scientists engaged in the
development project. The weapon was conceived by the British, Snodgrass
said, and research was pressed despite lack of enthusiasm shown by the
U.S. Navy officers who received reports during development.</FONT></FONT></FONT></P>

was mentioned in the birthday honors list of King George VI in London.
A news dispatch reported Professor Leech as calling the weapon an effective
alternative to the atomic bomb.</FONT></FONT></FONT></P>

<P><FONT FACE="ARIAL,HELVETICA"><FONT COLOR="#FFFF00"><FONT SIZE=-1>Asked
whether the weapon could replace the atomic bomb, Snodgrass said only:
&quot;First reports are substantially true, but perhaps they are exaggerated
a little.&quot;</FONT></FONT></FONT></P>

<P><FONT FACE="ARIAL,HELVETICA"><FONT COLOR="#FFFF00"><FONT SIZE=-1>The
research was conducted in New Zealand because of fears of espionage, Snodgrass
said, although it had been planned to transfer the work to Florida.</FONT></FONT></FONT></P>

<P><FONT FACE="ARIAL,HELVETICA"><FONT COLOR="#FFFF00"><FONT SIZE=-1>Snodgrass,
who is married and has two children, formerly was an instructor of psychology

<P><FONT COLOR="#000000">Here may be some additional details relevant to
the alleged 'Secret Weapon' referenced in a 1947 Cincinnati Enquirer newspaper
article. </FONT></P>

<P><FONT COLOR="#000000">Apparently the papers of James Marion Snodgrass
were sought after by the Scripps Institute of Oceanography in 1995, as
per the following item from: </FONT></P>

of Eugene La Fond documenting work at sea during the 1960's and the papers
of James Marion Snodgrass (38 cartons). The Snodgrass papers were received
with a deposit agreement. A deed of gift is under negotiation now. We also
received an original 1969 political cartoon signed by Ronald Reagan concerning
state oceans policy and slides of work at sea from Peter Brueggeman.&quot;</FONT></TT></P>

<UL>
<P><FONT COLOR="#000000">This item was courtesy of <U>Mr. Bob Barnes,</U>
who located it while browsing through a search engine under the name of
SNODGRASS. I would be inclined to wager that the James Marion Snodgrass
indicated in this article may be the same as from the '47 newspaper report,
as the &quot;James Marion Snodgrass&quot; combination of 3-names together
seems quite rare.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT COLOR="#000000">It appears that the Scripps Institute of Oceanography
knew of Snodgrass and had an interest in the acquisition of some of his
files, which may or may-not be relevant to this 'Secret' situation he was
reportedly involved with while at the motion picture division of the Dayton
Acme Company [Dayton, Ohio?].</FONT></P>

<P><FONT COLOR="#000000">Upon reading the '47 article, I first presumed
that this exotic weapon was perhaps related to the projection of images
-holograms, as per his association with a 'motion picture division' of
the Dayton Acme Co., but upon closer scrutiny, the term 'weapon' and comparison
to &quot;A-bomb potential&quot; seems to negate that possibility, as holographic
projection would only serve as a potential counter-measure in any battlefield
application and not have destructive capability as the term 'weapon' would
imply.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT COLOR="#000000">I also surmised that this weapon may be an early
EMP [Electromagnetic Pulse] bomb. However, according to a report by Defence
Analyst <U>Carlo Kopp</U> entitled: <B>&quot;The Electromagnetic Bomb -
a Weapon of Electrical Mass Destruction,</B>&quot; Kopp states, &quot;The
ElectroMagnetic Pulse [EMP] effect was first observed during the early
testing of high altitude airburst nuclear weapons.&quot; This statement
indicates that the EMP effect was observed *after* the conflict at Tarawa,
which was during WWII at which time no high altitude atomic tests had been
conducted there. </FONT></P>

<P><FONT COLOR="#000000">The second person mentioned in the article, Professor
Leech, would be another name to keep alert for.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT COLOR="#000000">In light of Snodgrass' connection to The Scripps
Institute of Oceanography, I think it could be plausible that the alleged
&quot; Secret Weapon&quot; could be nautically based. What seems puzzling
is how that Snodgrass could go from a Chief engineer of the motion picture
division of the Dayton Acme Co., a consultant engineering firm in Ohio
from 1947, to having papers considered valuable to the Scripps Institute
of Oceanography in 1995.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT COLOR="#000000">Further, our understanding of the Tarawa Battle
during WWII may shed some light on this. A Navy-Marines operation was enacted
in the Central Pacific against Japan in August of 1943. The following information
was found at:<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<U>https://ac.acusd.edu/History/WW2Timeline/CRAIGE/doc1.html</U></FONT></P>

<CENTER><TABLE BORDER=1 CELLSPACING=0 CELLPADDING=0 >

<TR>
<TD><TT><FONT COLOR="#090909">The Marshall Islands would serve as an air
base from which further operations could be launched against the Marianas,
and from there against the Japanese home islands. But 500 miles to the
southeast of the Marshalls, an archipelago of atolls called the Gilberts
stood between U.S. forward ground air bases and the Marshalls. </FONT></TT>
<P><TT><FONT COLOR="#090909">The Gilberts had only one workable airstrip
for refueling American aircraft and that was on the island of Betio in
the western Gilbert Island atoll of Tarawa. </FONT></TT></P>

<P><TT><FONT COLOR="#090909">The Japanese commander in charge of the defense
of Tarawa, Rear Admiral Keiji Shibasaki, said &quot;A million men cannot
take Tarawa in a hundred years.&quot; He commanded 2,600 imperial marines,
the best amphibious troops in the Japanese armed forces. With the importation
of 1,000 Japanese workers and 1,200 Korean laborers the island airstrip
of Betio had been transformed into one of the most formidable fortresses
in the world, boasting 14 coastal defense guns(four of which were taken
from the surrendered British garrison at Singapore), 40 strategically located
artillery pieces, covering every approach to the island, a coconut-log
sea wall four feet high lining the lagoon and over 100 machine gun emplacements
behind the wall. All this was concentrated on an island only a mile long
and a few hundred yards wide. </FONT></TT></P>

<P><TT><FONT COLOR="#090909">Meanwhile an armada of 17 carriers, 12 battleships,
eight heavy and four light cruisers, 66 destroyers and 36 transports carrying
the 2nd Marine Division and a part of the 37th Infantry Division- some
35,000 soldiers and Marines headed for Betio in early November of 1943.
</FONT></TT></P>

<P><TT><FONT COLOR="#090909">In the moments before pre-invasion bombardment
began, the task force naval commander, Rear Admiral Howard F. Kingman announced
to the landing troops &quot;Gentlemen, we will not neutralize Betio. We
will not destroy it. We will obliterate it!&quot; </FONT></TT></P>

<P><TT><FONT COLOR="#090909">Neither Shibasaki nor Kingman knew what they
were up against.</FONT></TT></P>

<P><FONT COLOR="#000000">Thanks to Jim Martin for the information regarding
Tarawa.</FONT></P>

nothing substantive indicating that this strange story is UFO-related.
