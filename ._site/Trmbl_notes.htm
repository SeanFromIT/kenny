<P><FONT COLOR="#FFFF00"><FONT SIZE=+1>Notes: UFO/9-1-1 Police Incident,
12-14-94</FONT></FONT> </P>

<P><FONT COLOR="#FFFF00"><FONT SIZE=-1>This is a brief summation on the
9-1-1 dispatch tapes from the December 14, 1994 Trumbull County Disturbance.
A more exacting transcript is being prepared. </FONT></FONT>
<HR WIDTH="100%"></P>

<P><FONT COLOR="#FFFF00"><FONT SIZE=-1>An object was first visually observed
at a treetop level before midnight in the vicinity of Samson Drive and
the Fifth Avenue Extension. It was bluish-green with flames. Four calls
were placed to the dispatch office before midnight, and these calls are
not on the present tape. An additional call was placed to WYTV Channel-33
news reporter 'Stacey.'</FONT></FONT></P>

<P><FONT COLOR="#FFFF00"><FONT SIZE=-1>A unit (#998) is dispatched to Samson
Drive to investigate.</FONT></FONT></P>

<P><FONT COLOR="#FFFF00"><FONT SIZE=-1>At the point Unit #998 [Tobe Melero]
views the object at close range, it is now red, and illuminating the ground
with a tremendous red light &quot;as bright as daylight.&quot; From all
accounts, the object was described as 'huge.' [Melero later stated that
he encountered an elderly man who was wandering in the roadway, saying:
&quot;it was right above my house!&quot; He also stated that when he drew
near to the object, he felt that it effected the electronic instrumentation
of his patrol cruiser]</FONT></FONT></P>

<P><FONT COLOR="#FFFF00"><FONT SIZE=-1>Having reported his observation,
other units are now dispatched for backup and a call is placed to the airbase
by the dispatcher. There is no answer at the airbase, and a call is then
placed to the FAA tower, where the tower operator states to have nothing
on his radarscope within a 60-mile radius of Youngstown.</FONT></FONT></P>

<P><FONT COLOR="#FFFF00"><FONT SIZE=-1>At this point, the unidentified
aircraft departs from the Samson Road area (is is not known the nature
of departure whether it be with path N, S, E or W, ascention, fade from
view, etc). Interestingly, Unit #998 advises that he was 'out of service'
for a duration to &quot;gather his thoughts.&quot; The time is near 1:00
a.m.</FONT></FONT></P>

<P><FONT COLOR="#FFFF00"><FONT SIZE=-1>The UFO is again reported when Unit
#429 advises central dispatch that an object is spotted to the east of
the 9-1-1 center. The dispatcher, eager to view the object, steps away
to look for the UFO as another person takes her place.</FONT></FONT></P>

<P><FONT COLOR="#FFFF00"><FONT SIZE=-1>The object is said to be near Route
11, and several units from different locations and directions triangulate
its position from areas near Kings Grave and Henheid. The object is now
over an empty field, and changes color from whitish red to a pulsating
greenish lavender.</FONT></FONT></P>

<P><FONT COLOR="#FFFF00"><FONT SIZE=-1>The dispatcher returns, saying that
she did not see the UFO. More incoming radio traffic relevant to the UFO
causes her to 'take a break' where she plans to meet an officer who will
pick her up and take her to see it [During my 1996 interview with Royanne
Rudolph, she said that finally did see the lighted object, and it resembled
a 'red, rotating saucer'].</FONT></FONT></P>

<P><FONT COLOR="#FFFF00"><FONT SIZE=-1>Through heavy radio traffic, several
unspecified police units converge upon the UFO and triangulate its position.</FONT></FONT></P>

<P><FONT COLOR="#FFFF00"><FONT SIZE=-1>This documented triangulation of
an aerial object from different vantage points indicates to us that it
is not a star, as the object maintains a localized presence within a specific
area (A star cannot be triangulated from units approaching in different
directions). One unit claims that he is heading east to approach the object,
another unit advises that he is heading north to approach the object. A
unit headed eastbound advised that the object was 'southeast' of his location.</FONT></FONT></P>

<P><FONT COLOR="#FFFF00"><FONT SIZE=-1>The object remains stationary for
a duration over this empty field prior to a departure path to the southeast,
where it is seen near an 84-Lumber hardware store. There it is described
as a structured object with an attachment or unspecified element protruding
from the top of it.</FONT></FONT></P>

<P><FONT COLOR="#FFFF00"><FONT SIZE=-1>Every police department in the county
now has the object under observation, and many units are now pursuing the
UFO from different departments and localities.</FONT></FONT></P>

<P><FONT COLOR="#FFFF00"><FONT SIZE=-1>Several units are maintaining the
object under binocular observation, and discern a 'parachute-like' structure
attached to the object. One unit tries to signal the object.</FONT></FONT></P>

<P><FONT COLOR="#FFFF00"><FONT SIZE=-1>One officer, who is at the airbase,
is also observing the object from his vantage point. Present with him to
view the UFO is a security guard at the airbase.</FONT></FONT></P>

<P><FONT COLOR="#FFFF00"><FONT SIZE=-1>At this point, &quot;several&quot;
objects are suddenly under scrutiny by law enforcement officials. This
is announced rather cryptically, as the officer states: &quot;We have both
of them under visual observation, I think you'll know what I mean.&quot;
It is not known if the main object 'split' into several objects (a frequent
element reported in UFO sightings) or if additional objects were generated
elsewhere or 'arrived' on the scene.</FONT></FONT></P>

<P><FONT COLOR="#FFFF00"><FONT SIZE=-1>One specific object, described as
a 'white light,' appeared over the airbase, where a police officer was
present to report it.</FONT></FONT></P>

<P><FONT COLOR="#FFFF00"><FONT SIZE=-1>Pursuit of these objects continued
for some time, and it was again stressed that all departments in the county
were concerned with the situation, and held the object(s) under visual
observation.</FONT></FONT></P>

<P><FONT COLOR="#FFFF00"><FONT SIZE=-1>All objects ascended to a high elevation
and appeared as stars in the sky. As the objects were viewed at a high
elevation, others on the police force that did not place a close range
observation of the main object, while at its low elevation, assumed that
everyone else had mis-identified planets and shooting stars.</FONT></FONT></P>

<P><FONT COLOR="#FFFF00"><FONT SIZE=-1>Some on the police force mused that
stealth technology was employed to negate radar detection, some speculated
that they weren't being told of a secret project from the airbase.</FONT></FONT></P>

<P><FONT COLOR="#FFFF00"><FONT SIZE=-1>Toward the end of the event, jets
were seen in the area, and one officer believed they were military jets
from the airbase scrambled to engage the objects.</FONT></FONT></P>

<P><FONT COLOR="#FFFF00"><FONT SIZE=-1>One officer refuted the 'planet'
comment, but stated that there were shooting stars visible. He stated that
there were six shooting stars in the same part of the sky that the UFO
was seen in.</FONT></FONT></P>

<P><FONT COLOR="#FFFF00"><FONT SIZE=-1>One unit took exception to the remark
that planets were mistaken as UFOs, and he added: &quot;What I saw was
not a planet, it was 50-feet off the ground and lit up the whole area like
daylight.&quot;</FONT></FONT></P>

<P><FONT COLOR="#FFFF00"><FONT SIZE=-1>It is thought that the event ended
around 6:00 a.m. from previous discussions with officials involved, although
a specific time is not reflected on the tape.</FONT></FONT></P>

<P><FONT COLOR="#FFFF00"><FONT SIZE=-1>A UFO sighting was reported on the
previous evening, and also two weeks earlier.</FONT></FONT></P>

<P><FONT COLOR="#FFFF00"><FONT SIZE=-1>End of notes</FONT></FONT></P>
