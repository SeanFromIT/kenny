<p><b><font size=+1><u>From "A History of UFO Crashes" by Kevin D. Randle:</u>
The crash of a small clamshell-shaped object in the Tobacco Root Mountains
of western Montana was alleged by Vernon Baird, the pilot of a commercial
photographic plane. Baird reported that he was at 32-thousand feet and
flying at 360 miles an hour when one of the "flying discs" appeared behind
him, got caught in the prop wash of his plane and came apar like a clamshell,
spiralling down. He said the object was a "pearl gray, clam-shaped airplane
with a plexiglass dome on top." The one had been part of a formation of
several that Baird and his photographer, George Suttin, had spotted. The
next day, Baird's boss, J.J. Archer, claimed the whole thing to be a hoax.
Archer said that Baird and the other pilots had "made up the story for
something to do."</font></b>
