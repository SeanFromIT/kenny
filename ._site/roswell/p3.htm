<p><font size=-1 face="arial, arial narrow, helvetica"><b>KENNY YOUNG:</b>
Now again, you're talking about the Ragsdale site. Hasn't the Ragsdale
account been discredited?</font> </p>
<p><font size=-1 face="arial, arial narrow, helvetica"><b>LARRY ROGERS:</b>
In their later books, Randle and Schmidt have discredited the account.
The museum people will tell you that this is the real crash site. It just
happens to be on Federal property, where there is no issue concerning who
holds the rights to take tours. So anyway, I go back there, and I sit down
on a smaller rock next to the big rock. I am taking some notes while Curt
is taking measurements and looking at compass bearings -- we were trying
to determine where northwest was. I am in somewhat deep thought, sort of
day dreaming, when I notice something lying on the ground not more that
five feet away. <i>I don't believe this,</i> I think to myself. I can't
disclose what it was.</font>
<p><font size=-1 face="arial, arial narrow, helvetica">That large
rock has a curved shape at its very bottom. I see a shiny object back up
under the edge of the rock, just where it meets the ground. I holler for
Curt, to tell him to come and look at what I had found. I pick this thing
up. I have it in my hand and tell Curt <i>You're not going to believe what
I found under that rock.</i> I open my hand to show it to him, and he says
<i>I'll
be damned. Where did you find that?</i> I take him back and point to where
I found it. I kneel down, and point to the exact spot. Amazed, he says
<i>Well
there's another one.</i></font>
<p><font size=-1 face="arial, arial narrow, helvetica"><b>CURT ROBINSON:</b>
That is no lie, we found another one right there.</font>
<p><font size=-1 face="arial, arial narrow, helvetica"><b>CHRIS COFFEY:</b>
Could this stuff have been planted?</font>
<p><font size=-1 face="arial, arial narrow, helvetica">LR: Well,
we wondered the same thing. It certainly appeared to be old, although we
found it in plain sight. It was just located in place that you would not
normally look. Remember, I was taking notes. I was in one of those trances
you get into when trying to put down in words something that is not easy
to explain. The only reason that I noticed it was because my stare happened
to be in the right direction. Remember that first thing we found while
driving up? We could tell that thing had interacted with nature over a
number of years. We know it could not have been planted, at least if it
was, it happened many, many years ago. No, there was a lot of decay involved.
The second things we found could have been planted, I suppose, but I don't
know why anybody would do that.</font>
<p><font size=-1 face="arial, arial narrow, helvetica">CR: You wouldn't
plant the things we found. They don't fit the story in such a way that
it would make sense to plant them.</font>
<p><font size=-1 face="arial, arial narrow, helvetica">LR: To us
there was no apparent connection to the story, except for one bizarre twist
that occurred to me over dinner, later that night. That was the point at
which I got a bit shook up.</font>
<p><font size=-1 face="arial, arial narrow, helvetica">CC: But it
was enough to get you on the right path?</font>
<p><font size=-1 face="arial, arial narrow, helvetica">LR: Well,
let's just say there would be NO WAY that THAT belonged there. There are
two tracks we tell of in the book. One track is about Curt and I, and everything
we have done along the way. The other track is a historical track, in which
we write about what happened in 1947. To help the reader visualize how
the well known testimony of the crash witnesses fits with our findings
and the documented history of the period, we have created <i>scenarios,</i>
and we always tell the reader when we do this, where we connect one piece
of the puzzle to another. There is one chapter in fact, which I wish now
I had entitled 'Roswell for dummies.' We included this one for the reader
who may not have heard of the Roswell incident before picking up our book.
That reader would need to know certain fundamentals.</font>
<p><font size=-1 face="arial, arial narrow, helvetica">CR: That's
the disadvantage, because some people aren't familiar with the Roswell
story.</font>
<p><font size=-1 face="arial, arial narrow, helvetica">LR: So anyway,
back to the top of the mountain. I am telling Curt that this has been a
really weird day.</font>
<p><font size=-1 face="arial, arial narrow, helvetica">CR: Right,
and about that time, we find something else. I'm not going to tell you
what we found, only because right now, it's best we not. If people knew
about it, there might well be a stampede up there. All we will say is that
while we were there, we made a new discovery...</font>
<p><font size=-1 face="arial, arial narrow, helvetica">LR: We were
walking back toward the road, ready to leave.</font>
<p><font size=-1 face="arial, arial narrow, helvetica">CR: It was
quite bizarre. Really interesting. I wanted to go back, later that night,
under the cover of darkness. It was wild.</font>
<p><font size=-1 face="arial, arial narrow, helvetica">LR: We drove
into Roswell, and it was pretty late. We went to a nice steak house in
Roswell. I think it was around 10 o'clock. I was ready to have this day
be over, but as we always do at the end of a day like that, Curt and I
were discussing the artifacts we had brought back. I thought perhaps we
should turn over one thing in particular to the local law enforcement authorities.</font>
<p><font size=-1 face="arial, arial narrow, helvetica">CR: We won't
tell you what it was, but Larry thought the right thing to do would be
to turn it in.</font>
<p><font size=-1 face="arial, arial narrow, helvetica">CC: Turn it
in for what reason?</font>
<p><font size=-1 face="arial, arial narrow, helvetica">LR: I don't
really want to go there.</font>
<p><font size=-1 face="arial, arial narrow, helvetica">CR: We're
not going in that direction, period. We can't tell you.</font>
<p><font size=-1 face="arial, arial narrow, helvetica">LR: I just
felt like we shouldn't have left the state of New Mexico with this in our
possession. I really wanted to get rid of it... I just didn't want to have
it.</font>
<p><font size=-1 face="arial, arial narrow, helvetica">CR: He was
chicken, that's what it was all about. Then we found something else up
there, a couple of things up there, before we left.</font>
<p><font size=-1 face="arial, arial narrow, helvetica">LR: Don't
call me chicken. You were wanting to go back and here I'm wanting to go
to the police and turn this stuff in... I was really a basket case.</font>
<p><font size=-1 face="arial, arial narrow, helvetica">CR: It's all
strange. I mean, why did we go to this site? I suppose, deep down inside,
we felt that there wasn't anything significant about this site, as people
claim. When we get to the site, strange things start happening to us. All
of the strange things which happen to us fit into the overall mystery,
so to speak, but only Larry and I know that as we sit in this room. It
fits into the mystery -but has nothing to do with the mystery- but it IS
part of the mystery.</font>
<p><font size=-1 face="arial, arial narrow, helvetica">LR: As we
sat there in the restaurant at the end of the day, we didn't see things
as we do now. After we reflected upon it, we began putting things into
perspective.</font>
<p><font size=-1 face="arial, arial narrow, helvetica">CC: You had
made a comment to us once that this case will one day be included in history
books. Did you come to suspect this at that time?</font>
<p><font size=-1 face="arial, arial narrow, helvetica">LR: Well,
you're getting real close to areas we can't discuss. We can't cross that
line.</font>
<p><font size=-1 face="arial, arial narrow, helvetica">CR: Let's
not go there.</font>
<p><font size=-1 face="arial, arial narrow, helvetica">KY: Tell us
why we can't cross that line.</font>
<p><font size=-1 face="arial, arial narrow, helvetica">LR: The details
are in the book. We have to leave some things to the imagination -- for
now.</font>
<p><font size=-1 face="arial, arial narrow, helvetica">CR: Yes, it
could change history as we know it.</font>
<p><font size=-1 face="arial, arial narrow, helvetica">LR: As far
as what becomes history, let me tell you about a similar situation concerning
a man by the name of Paul Brown, who writes on-record that, while a patient
in a military hospital, he witnessed the tearing-off of the front-pages
of The Honolulu Advertiser on Saturday, November 30, 1941. He happened
to acquire one of those front pages, and included it in a letter to his
parents. Of interest is the headline: it said 'JAPS MAY ATTACK OVER THE
WEEKEND.' The U.S. Military ordered all of the front pages of this day's
newspaper torn off, but did nothing for to increase the security of the
base. Some twenty years later, Brown is going through his deceased mother's
belongings, and finds that she had kept all the letters that he had sent
home during the war. He wonders about that newspaper. He finds it. It turns
out to be one of only two original copies now in existence. The other belongs
to the archives of the State of Hawaii. <i>Does this event re-write history
books?</i></font>
<p><font size=-1 face="arial, arial narrow, helvetica">CR: You don't
see history books re-written right now, do you? Let's put it this way...
if you or I were writing the history books, they would be changed. How's
that?</font><p><b>Famous hangar at Roswell Army</b> <b>Air Field</b> taken in 
1996<br>
<img border="0" src="hanger84.jpg" align="left" width="511" height="348"><font size=-1 face="arial, arial narrow, helvetica">LR: That story
I just related to you is true. It has changed the way I think about 1941.
Now, have I read in history books that the United States government was
looking for a reason to get into The War? No. Public opinion must be positive
about it, the leaders felt. What better way than to be attacked? We basically
had big signs that said 'drop your bombs here.' Oh, by the way, some darned
reporter had to find out about it, so darn him, we had to tear off the
front pages of his newspaper.</font>
<p><font size=-1 face="arial, arial narrow, helvetica">CC: Could
you see a similarity in the way history presently views Pearl Harbor and
how we will one day think of Roswell?</font>
<p><font size=-1 face="arial, arial narrow, helvetica">LR: Even after
fifty years, things can happen that really change the way you look at certain
events.</font>
<p><font size=-1 face="arial, arial narrow, helvetica">CR: Yeah,
you can certainly change history as what is fact... if you care to believe
it. In order to write a history book, all you have to do to write it is
to believe it. What has to happen in order for someone to say 'this is
now history.' How many people have to believe it? Does it have to be The
United States or another country?</font><p><font size=-1 face="arial, arial narrow, helvetica">LR: One person
has to believe it.</font>
<p><font size=-1 face="arial, arial narrow, helvetica">CR: And then
it becomes history.</font>
<p><font size=-1 face="arial, arial narrow, helvetica">LR: I can
pick up one history book that talks about those darn southerners, and I
can pick up another which talks about those darn northerners.</font>
<p><font size=-1 face="arial, arial narrow, helvetica">CR: So when
you ask if this will have an impact on history... yeah, it probably will.</font>
<p><font size=-1 face="arial, arial narrow, helvetica">CC: Do you
think that your discoveries will continue the controversy around Roswell,
or will there still be two different camps believing different things?</font>
<p><font size=-1 face="arial, arial narrow, helvetica">LR: I wish
I knew the answer to your question. I read the newspaper daily. To me,
our current political problems are real clear. Yet, if we are to believe
the polls, 70 percent of the people don't get it. Now, 1947 is real clear
to me, but I suspect there will always be a controversy.</font>
<p><font size=-1 face="arial, arial narrow, helvetica">KY: Are your
findings factually based or subject to interpretation? Will your readers
come away knowing for sure that your findings are in order?</font>
<p><font size=-1 face="arial, arial narrow, helvetica">LR: There
is a lot of history in our book. A lot of documented history, and here
again, based upon the person that believes history, I guess, the reader
will find the book extremely factual.</font>
<p><font size=-1 face="arial, arial narrow, helvetica">CR: We haven't
been able to disprove anything we present, how's that?</font>
<p><font size=-1 face="arial, arial narrow, helvetica">CC: How will
you feel after the book has been reviewed, and you are confronted for this
evidence. Are you going to be forthcoming with your findings?</font>
<p><font size=-1 face="arial, arial narrow, helvetica">CR: Once the
book comes out, we'll not hold back any punches. We'll say: <i>There it
is. There you go.</i> Is it history or isn't it? You'll have to decide.</font>
<p><font size=-1 face="arial, arial narrow, helvetica"><b>DANNY RUSSELL:</b>
Did you confine all of your research to this area, or do you venture into
other subjects?</font>
<p><font size=-1 face="arial, arial narrow, helvetica">CR: Yes. We
have no idea what happened in 1982 or '85 or '87 or yesterday morning.</font>
<p><font size=-1 face="arial, arial narrow, helvetica">LR: Well,
I could tell you what happened in 1974. That's in the book, when I was
in the military when we spent the better part of an hour one night tracking
something strange by radar. We do talk about that.</font>
<p><font size=-1 face="arial, arial narrow, helvetica">KY: Does Wright-Patterson
Air Force Base play a significant role in your book?</font>
<p><font size=-1 face="arial, arial narrow, helvetica">CR: Wright-Pat
plays a role in the Roswell story, but we don't talk about that in the
book.</font>
<p><font size=-1 face="arial, arial narrow, helvetica">KY: So you
never address the alleged wreckage being taken to Wright-Pat?</font>
<p><font size=-1 face="arial, arial narrow, helvetica">CR: No.</font>
<p><font size=-1 face="arial, arial narrow, helvetica">KY: Any comments
on the weather balloon scenario?</font>
<p><font size=-1 face="arial, arial narrow, helvetica">CR: We won't
discuss it.</font>
<p><font size=-1 face="arial, arial narrow, helvetica">CC: What was
your focus that motivated your approach?</font>
<p><font size=-1 face="arial, arial narrow, helvetica">LR: We would
go to the library and just read magazines from that time period. We spent
a number of afternoons downtown reading LIFE or LOOK magazine, starting
from 1944 or 1945, just to get an understanding of that time-period. It's
hard to analyze things now in our time frame of lasers and computers compared
with how people thought back then. We tried to figure out why people would
say what they said and do what they did back in 1947.</font>
<p><font size=-1 face="arial, arial narrow, helvetica">KY: Let me
go back to the weather balloon story. Are you comfortable that this explanation
was or was not satisfactory.</font>
<p><font size=-1 face="arial, arial narrow, helvetica">LR: Oh, it's
all a cover story. It's all a cover story.</font>
<p><font size=-1 face="arial, arial narrow, helvetica">CR: So was
Project Mogul. That's a cover story. The crash dummies and Case Closed,
that's all a cover.</font>
<p><font size=-1 face="arial, arial narrow, helvetica">KY: Any comments
on Lt. Col. Phillip Corso and his sworn affidavit?</font>
<p><font size=-1 face="arial, arial narrow, helvetica">CR: Well,
he passed away. He was entertaining. When you bought his book, you spent
your money and got something entertaining to read. He does have some historical
data in his book, that is positive.</font>
<p><font size=-1 face="arial, arial narrow, helvetica">LR: We both
have a copy of it.</font>
<p><font size=-1 face="arial, arial narrow, helvetica">KY: Have other
Roswell researchers had the chance to find out what you know, or could
have blundered upon your findings at some point eventually, and do you
make any comments on these researchers?</font>
<p><font size=-1 face="arial, arial narrow, helvetica">CR: We don't
form any opinion on those people. Some do good work.</font>
<p><font size=-1 face="arial, arial narrow, helvetica">LR: Everyone
has a different opinion.</font>
<p><font size=-1 face="arial, arial narrow, helvetica">KY: How about
Jim Knippenburgh? How did he come upon your story?</font>
<p><font size=-1 face="arial, arial narrow, helvetica">LR: My brother
wanted to read the book really badly. He felt like he could help Curt and
I out by doing us a favor and contacting a reporter. It was coming upon
the 50th anniversary of Roswell, so he called The Cincinnati Enquirer...
he 'kind of' asked us if he could do this, so we didn't really have any
big objection. He called down there and talked to Knippenburgh... that's
about all he knew.</font>
<p><font size=-1 face="arial, arial narrow, helvetica">CR: That's
how the thing got started, because we weren't going around telling anybody
that we had this book. We hadn't done this for the money, we would keep
spending money. The book became the document of the 'solution to Roswell.'
Here was a mystery to be solved. We didn't really care that much about
the monetary end of it... so anyway Knippenburgh called up and that's how
the whole thing became public.</font>
<p><font size=-1 face="arial, arial narrow, helvetica">KY: Did you
have to tell Knippenburgh what you know in order to get him to publish
this article?</font>
<p><font size=-1 face="arial, arial narrow, helvetica">LR: We didn't
tell him any more than what is in the article. We did have a copy of the
book laying in front of him though.</font>
<p><font size=-1 face="arial, arial narrow, helvetica">CC: Did you
have any reservations about coming out with this story, either out of fear
or obligation?</font>
<p><font size=-1 face="arial, arial narrow, helvetica">LR: I continue
to have reservations.</font>
<p><font size=-1 face="arial, arial narrow, helvetica">CR: I am not
<i>100%
sure </i>that any of us really NEED to know what REALLY happened at Roswell.
We're not sure that people should really know that.</font>
<p><font size=-1 face="arial, arial narrow, helvetica">KY: In the
Knippenburg article, he quotes you as saying that what happened is the
'tip of the iceberg.'</font>
<p><font size=-1 face="arial, arial narrow, helvetica">CR: It's the
tip of the iceberg because there is a lot more to the story. There's much
more to the story. The book is around 300-pages. It might take a week to
read it.</font>
<p><font size=-1 face="arial, arial narrow, helvetica">LR: A lot
of the content is footnotes.</font>

<p><font size=-1 face="arial, arial narrow, helvetica">CR: The more
we researched, the bigger Roswell got. We couldn't find the edges, as if
it were a puzzle that kept getting bigger. We think we solved the mystery.
We found something.</font>
<p><font size=-1 face="arial, arial narrow, helvetica">KY: How many
years have you spent investigating this case?</font>
<p><font size=-1 face="arial, arial narrow, helvetica">LR: At least
a two-year investigation. As we researched this topic, we collected a library
of books. When we would see something we would mark the page. That might
result in a new thread, which would then take us down another path, where
we would have to buy ten more books.</font>

everything on Roswell we could get our hands on.</font>
<p><font size=-1 face="arial, arial narrow, helvetica">LR: As I worked
through this, I decided to keep track of what this was costing me. Last
year alone I spent about $4,000.00 in research expenses, travel and books.</font>
