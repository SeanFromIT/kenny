<br>July 14, 1947
<p>Headline:<br>
<b>ELABORATE "SAUCER"&nbsp; FOUND AT MILLFIELD HAS ONE WEAKNESS: IT JUST
WON'T FLY!</b>
<p>A proposterous gadget found in the grass in front of the Millfield post
office lot Saturday morning is evidently some practical jokers effort to
reproduce on of the famed "flying Saucers' in the opinion of sherriff George
Bateman and John E. Edwards of Ohio University physics dept.
<p>A mailman picked up the device and was quoted as saying: "I don't think
this thing is a flying saucer but I don't know what it could be."
<p>Most of the excitment abated when the sherriff and a Messenger reporter
arrived to investigate.
<p>The weird looking contraption was put into the back of the sheriffs
car and spirited to Athens where Dr. Edwards was summonds to give his opinion.&nbsp;
The physicist said he had no idea how the contraption was suppose to operate.
<p>About 18 inches long the 'saucer' was made from an old street light
reflector and green paint with a strange assortment of automobile parts
and radio parts. Very noticeable was the radio tube hanging loosely by
connecting wires in the center of the disk.
<p>As if to make the gadget more mysterious, some unknown marksmen had
shot two holes in&nbsp; the reflector possibly bringing it
<br>down as there was a dent from inpact with the ground.&nbsp; The sheriff
says a .38 caliber weapon was used.
<p>Dr. Edwards say there was no source of electric power for the contraption
although several wires, a coil from a radio, a
<br>miniature spark plug such as used in model airplanes engines, a small
condenser coil of the type used in voltage regulators on automoblies and
a set of breaker points from an auto, in addition to the radio tube was
seen.
<p>The theory that a battery might have furnished power was discarded when
no indication of where it may of been placed was found.&nbsp; What seemed
to be a auto carburetor is bolted to one side. A 20 millimeter gun shell
is attached to the&nbsp; one end of the carburetor and a series of old
brass pipes fittings ended in what seemed to be a nozzle. Extending from
the nozzle was black soot&nbsp; as if flames had shot out of it.
<p>Whoever made this gadget is having a good laugh at all the fuss.&nbsp;
The sheriff added: "The pranster went to alot of trouble for a joke."
<p>Bateman says he plans to investigate further in an effort to discover
the perpetator.
