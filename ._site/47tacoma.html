TACOMA, Wash., Aug. 6 � (U.P.) Bits of black rock which two Tacomans said
they picked up on Mary Island near here were definitely pieces of slag
from the Tacoma copper smelter, Dr. Robert Springer, College of Puget Sound
geological analysis department professor, said Tuesday.
<p>Springer ran a qualitative analysis on the material turned over to United
Press by H.A. Dahl, whose boat � according to Boise, Idaho and Chicago
newspapers � was struck by �falling fragments which might be from a flying
saucer.� Dahl himself denied the newspapers� accounts and said he had found
the bits of stone on the shore of Maury Island.
<p>However, he admitted United Air Lines Capt. E.J. Smith and Kenneth Arnold,
two early disc observers, had shown interest in samples of the material
during their secret disc conference here this weekend.

BOISE, Aug. 2 � (A.P.) The Idaho Statesman tonight said Capt. E. H. Smith
of United Air Lines told the newspaper he had given the pilot and co-pilot
killed in an army bomber crash yesterday six pieces of �metal or lava�
to take back to Hamilton field, Cal., for inspection.
<p>The Statesmen said Smith telephoned from Tacoma, Wash., where the B-25
bomber took off yesterday shortly before it crashed at Kelso, Wash., killing
Capt. William L. Davidson of San Francisco and Lieut. Frank M. Brown, of
Vallejo, Cal., intelligence officers.
<p>Smith, the Statesman added, had gone to Tacoma with Kenneth Arnold,
Boise businessman and pilot who in June turned in the first report of seeing
a so-called �flying disc.�
<p>The two men were investigating a report that a disc or some object had
struck a boat belonging to Harold Dahl and Fred L. Crisman in that city.
Arnold told the Statesman the two boat-owners had salvaged pieces of �metal
or lava� from the accident.
<p>Smith did not identify the pieces, the Statesman said, but told the
newspaper he had given them to the two army officers. He added that he
did not know where the pieces are at present.
<p>The United pilot several weeks ago reported sighting what he said appeared
to be a flight of flying discs. He was piloting an airliner in Boise at
the time.
