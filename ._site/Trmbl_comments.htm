<P><FONT COLOR="#FFFF00"><FONT SIZE=-1>Hi Kenny, </FONT></FONT></P>

<P><FONT COLOR="#FFFF00"><FONT SIZE=-1>I kinda got excited about the tape
that you aired on sightings. I would hope that you could squeeze me in
on the list of people that would like a copy. I'm sorry that I have to
cut this message short, but now that I have stumbled onto your webpage,
I've got some exploring to do. Hope to hear from you soon! -- </FONT></FONT></P>

<P><FONT COLOR="#00FFFF">I listened with rapt attention to your Sightings
on the Radio broadcast when I was supposed to be writing a post-arbitration
brief (I'm a trial lawyer). It was like something out of a movie, complete
with the wisecracking cops and their equally funny dispatcher with a heart
of gold. We will all be looking forward to the transcript of the tapes.
It would be helpful if you would digitize the entire 911 tape, even with
the audio defects of the &quot;chase&quot; sequence so that people can
make their own evaluations. I am spreading the word among my friends about
your site.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT COLOR="#FF8000"><FONT SIZE=-1>Kenny,</FONT></FONT></P>

<P><FONT COLOR="#FF8000"><FONT SIZE=-1>As for [the reporter's] behavior,
I think a story is a story. If the story is good and well documented and
&quot;investigatable&quot; and authentic and shocking then the reporter
has a scoop...</FONT></FONT></P>

<P><FONT COLOR="#FF8000"><FONT SIZE=-1>Unless there is some pressure coming
from somewhere [Twilight Zone theme please] - which I believe is the case.</FONT></FONT></P>

<P><FONT COLOR="#FF8000"><FONT SIZE=-1>With all the people involved that
night, I am sure Adger is not the only journalist who heard about the story.</FONT></FONT></P>

<P><FONT COLOR="#FF8000"><FONT SIZE=-1>Why didn't somebody do something
at the time ?</FONT></FONT></P>

<P><FONT COLOR="#FF8000"><FONT SIZE=-1>Regards,</FONT></FONT></P>

<P><FONT COLOR="#FF8000"><FONT SIZE=-1>Serge</FONT></FONT></P>

<P><FONT COLOR="#FF8000"><FONT SIZE=-1>PS: I went on the site for real
audio but it was impossible at 8 am ET to get more than garbage sounds.
I got &quot;Server to busy...&quot; message ?!? I had to resort to the
thread to get proper info.</FONT></FONT></P>

<P><FONT COLOR="#FF8000"><FONT SIZE=-1>Do you plan on making a CD Rom of
the case ? </FONT></FONT></P>

<P><FONT COLOR="#E7E7E7"><FONT SIZE=-1>Hello Kenny,</FONT></FONT></P>

<P><FONT COLOR="#E7E7E7"><FONT SIZE=-1>I've actually been to [your] web
site some time ago, and read the story about the UFO pursuit with some
interest. However, I moved into the Trumbull county area, from Cleveland,
in early 1996, and have since moved back into Cleveland earlier this year.
I have left my web site up, since there is no site I am aware of that covers
this area, if someone makes a new site, I might take mine down.</FONT></FONT></P>

<P><FONT COLOR="#E7E7E7"><FONT SIZE=-1>My main monitoring interest is Fire,
not Police, so most likely even if I had been in Trumbull county during
this time, I might have missed it, as usually the only Police I listen
to are those in which city I reside in. I have talked with a couple of
area scanner monitors via email, but none ever mentioned monitoring any
part of this incident.</FONT></FONT></P>

<P><FONT COLOR="#E7E7E7"><FONT SIZE=-1>Curiously enough, myself and a couple
other members of my family have had some missing time experiences, and
also I have strange memories of seeing faces when I was a child, which
I described then as being black and white (gray?), along with bloody noses,
which continue to this day, for no reason at all. I have not gone under
hypnosis as I guess I am afraid of what might come out of it. My interest
in UFO's continues to this day, more out of curiousity then anything else.
Though I have given some thought into joining or trying to help MUFON or
another UFO organization.</FONT></FONT></P>

due to his web-site regarding scanner frequencies for Trumbull County</FONT></FONT></I>

<P><FONT COLOR="#00FF00"><FONT SIZE=-1>Ken,</FONT></FONT></P>

<P><FONT COLOR="#00FF00"><FONT SIZE=-1>It occurs that there could be a
reason for certain news directors to withhold evidence of UFO. There could
be an &quot;ol boys&quot; network of rewards that are given to &quot;smart&quot;
[news] operators.</FONT></FONT></P>

<P><FONT COLOR="#00FF00"><FONT SIZE=-1>Maybe the fed will be proven to
reward &quot;loyal&quot; citizens for &quot;correct&quot; behavior. They
certainly seem to harass the folks who openly report same. Why not the
reverse?</FONT></FONT></P>

<P><FONT COLOR="#FF80FF"><FONT SIZE=-1>Kenny</FONT></FONT></P>

<P><FONT COLOR="#FF80FF"><FONT SIZE=-1>Think any of the police caught it
on the cameras in their cars? Do these police HAVE cameras in their patrol
cars?</FONT></FONT></P>

<P><FONT COLOR="#FFFF00">I am following this story closely as an interested
citizen and I want you to know that I will be checking your site for more
information. Please post any new findings, particularly a response (if
any) from your FAA inquiries).</FONT></P>

<HR WIDTH="100%"></P>

<P><FONT COLOR="#FF8000">Kenny,</FONT></P>

<P><FONT COLOR="#FF8000">Thank YOU for one of the most exciting programs
I've ever heard. You are doing what GREAT research is all about. I hope
this might pry some other dispatch tapes loose. I was very pleased that
dispatcher got a look, what a live wire she is. What a terrific story.
Our listeners heard something tonight they will not soon forget.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT COLOR="#FF8000">Best regards,</FONT></P>

<P><I><FONT COLOR="#FF00FF"><FONT SIZE=+1>Finally, this is the strangest
e-mail I received yet, and it is from Pat Mason, who took the 9-1-1 tape
and 'played it backward.' - KY</FONT></FONT></I></P>

<P><FONT COLOR="#FFFF00">Kenny</FONT></P>

<P><FONT COLOR="#FFFF00">You want to hear some reverse speech? I looked
at the part where the dispatcher is talking to the FAA. I wanted to find
out if they DID get something on radar [and played the tape in reverse].
This is so cool. </FONT></P>

<P><FONT COLOR="#FFFF00">So the dispatcher calls the FAA to ask if there
were any UFOs sighted on radar. She's told no, nothing was seen on radar.
She asks if it could be a helicopter that the officers are seeing adding
at one point that the object is making no sound. The FAA guy says, &quot;It
could be. It could be you know just it could be anything. Um. As far as
uh any kind of helicopter traffic, anything down low. They don't have any
kind of requirements to uh ...(dispatcher interjects something) ... closer
coming into the airport here.&quot;</FONT></P>

<P><FONT COLOR="#FFFF00">When he says, &quot;closer coming into the airport
here,&quot; in reverse he says, &quot;Track off for alien in a micro ...&quot;
The micro part sounds like Microsoft to me. It could be a metaphor for
software of any manufacturer.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT COLOR="#FFFF00">Next we have:</FONT></P>

<P><FONT COLOR="#FFFF00">Dispatcher, &quot;We are close to a hospital but
the location away from - as low as they said it was to the ground it would
be approximately five miles away from the hospital ...&quot; FAA, &quot;See
we don't had, we haven't had anything going on uh you know a (inaudible)
come up in that direction.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT COLOR="#FFFF00">When the FAA guy says, &quot;See we don't had,
we haven't had any--&quot; he reverses to say, &quot;There you have my
orders. They know you worry.&quot; </FONT></P>

<P><FONT COLOR="#FFFF00">Often when people stumble around for words you'll
find a reversal there.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT COLOR="#FFFF00">Finally:</FONT></P>

<P><FONT COLOR="#FFFF00">FAA, &quot;I don't see anything out there. Uh,
nothing on the radar scope. I haven't seen anything. And uh we really don't
do anything with the information.&quot;</FONT></P>

<P><FONT COLOR="#FFFF00">And when he says (talking about UFO reports to
the FAA), &quot;And uh we really don't do anything with the information.&quot;
In reverse he says, &quot;Sheriff, they command us...&quot;</FONT></P>

<P><FONT COLOR="#FFFF00">In a nutshell, I think the FAA here is under orders
not to reveal the presence of UFOs even to the police dept. </FONT></P>

<P><FONT COLOR="#FFFF00">The reversals generally compliment the forward
speech/words. In other words they directly relate and add information to
what is being said forwards.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT COLOR="#FFFF00">Have fun,</FONT></P>
