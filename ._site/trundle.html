"Shunned" is the word he sometimes uses.</font></b><p><b><font face="Arial,Helvetica">The title of his forthcoming book is,in part at least, in response to what he calls "the cowardice and vanityof a sizeable percentage of American professors." Scheduled for releaseearly next year, it's called "Is ET Here? No Politically, but Yes Scientificallyand Theologically" (EcceNova Editions, Victoria, British Columbia).</font></b><p><b><font face="Arial,Helvetica">Dr. Trundle, 60, occupies an almostmonastic office on the second floor of NKU's Landrum Hall. It's a roomabout 10 by 10, and every available square foot is piled high with textsof one sort or another. I was careful not to touch off an avalanche whenI sat among the stacks the other day and asked him to boil his book downto its basics.</font></b><p><b><font face="Arial,Helvetica">So what does he mean by that title?Do beings from places other than this planet walk among us?</font></b><p><b><font face="Arial,Helvetica">"Yes, I believe contact was made 50years ago -- and I believe beings from other planets are here now, mainlyto study us," Dr. Trundle said.</font></b><p><b><font face="Arial,Helvetica">"Does ET exist from a political perspective?No, because the government is afraid of the culture shock and public panic.For the government to acknowledge the existence of extraterrestrials herewould be to admit it can't protect us from them.</font></b><p><b><font face="Arial,Helvetica">"Scientifically, I argue that thousandsof well-regarded witness accounts cannot simply be dismissed. I'm talkingabout pilots who have come forward even though it's meant they've had toundergo psychiatric exams as a direct result."</font></b><p><b><font face="Arial,Helvetica">At the very least, he said, we can'tuse current science as the standard for excluding the possibility of amore advanced science:</font></b><p><b><font face="Arial,Helvetica">"For example, science says it's impossibleto travel at the speed of light. If it were possible, it would take fouryears of traveling at the speed of light to get to the nearest star system,Alpha Centauri.</font></b><p><b><font face="Arial,Helvetica">"Given our current technology, it wouldprobably take us 50,000 years to get there, plus or minus. Based on that,the scientific establishment somewhat blithely dismisses the existenceof extraterrestrials.</font></b><p><b><font face="Arial,Helvetica">"It's like saying if we can't do it,they can't do it either."</font></b><p><b><font face="Arial,Helvetica">Dr. Trundle's book is not an easy read,but it's an intriguing sampler of UFO lore, sightings and documents, includingthis Freedom of Information Act version of a March 22, 1950, FBI memo statingin part:</font></b><p><b><font face="Arial,Helvetica">"An investigator for the Air Force statedthat three so-called flying saucers had been recovered in New Mexico --circular in shape with raised centers, approximately 50 feet in diameter.Each -- occupied by three bodies of human shape but only 3 feet tall."</font></b><p><b><font face="Arial,Helvetica">It's a subject Dr. Trundle has beenchasing for years. His grandfather, president of the now-defunct TrundleEngineering Co. in Cleveland, was fascinated with extraterrestrials and,when he died in 1954, left Robert a small collection of books about UFOs.His first article to the effect that ETs are here, entitled "ExtraterrestrialIntelligence: Challenge to</font></b><p><b><font face="Arial,Helvetica">Theology, Physics and Metaphysics,"was published in 1994. His second book, "Illustrated News of the Unbelievable,"was co-authored with George Filer,</font></b><br><b><font face="Arial,Helvetica">a retired Air Force intelligence officer.</font></b><p><b><font face="Arial,Helvetica">Dr. Trundle paints a virtual "Men inBlack" picture of the ET scene in which several species are visiting theearth, most in a human form. But why?</font></b><p><b><font face="Arial,Helvetica">"There are benign scenarios in whichthey might be seen as anthropologists coming here out of curiosity," hesaid.</font></b><p><b><font face="Arial,Helvetica">"Then there is a more threatening scenario,which is that they're studying to see if the earth is habitable. An evenmore worrisome possibility is that they have a hybrid program of sexuallymating with humans to strengthen their species."</font></b><p><b><font face="Arial,Helvetica">No doubt about it. Dr. Trundle wouldhave an easier go of it if he stuck to Socrates.</font></b><p><b><font face="Arial,Helvetica">&nbsp;"But I'm trying to apply the truthin the way Socrates called for it to be applied to everyday life," he said.</font></b><p><b><font face="Arial,Helvetica">He's convinced he's right. All he'slacking is cold, hard proof.</font></b><p><b><font face="Arial,Helvetica">"If I had that, it would be the mostastonishing event since the resurrection of Christ."</font></b><p><font face="Arial,Helvetica"><font size=-1>Copyright 2004 The CincinnatiPost, an E.W.
