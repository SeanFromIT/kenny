<P><FONT FACE="ARIAL,HELVETICA"><FONT COLOR="#FFFF00">Date: Fri, 27 Nov
1998 </FONT></FONT></P>

<P><FONT FACE="ARIAL,HELVETICA"><FONT COLOR="#FFFF00">Please be informed
the UFO Research: Cincinnati! URL location has changed. The new address
is:</FONT></FONT></P>

<CENTER><P><B><FONT FACE="ARIAL,HELVETICA"><FONT COLOR="#FFFF00"><A HREF="https://kenny.anomalyresponse.com/">https://kenny.anomalyresponse.com/</A></FONT></FONT></B></P></CENTER>

<P><FONT FACE="ARIAL,HELVETICA"><FONT COLOR="#FFFF00">Please note that
my e-mail address has also changed. It is now:</FONT></FONT></P>

<CENTER><P><B><FONT FACE="ARIAL,HELVETICA"><FONT COLOR="#FFFF00"><A HREF="mailto:anomalyresponse@gmail.com">anomalyresponse@gmail.com</A></FONT></FONT></B></P></CENTER>

<P><FONT FACE="ARIAL,HELVETICA"><FONT COLOR="#FFFF00">The site was taken
offline last week to change the URL address from the previous &quot;task&quot;
acronym, which had been used since December 15, 1996, to the more practical
'ufo' designation.</FONT></FONT></P>

<P><FONT FACE="ARIAL,HELVETICA"><FONT COLOR="#FFFF00">The site began under
the 'task' acronym for the organization Tri-State Advocates for Scientific
Knowledge, which had dissolved in 1997 due to an honest difference of investigative
focus by its members. The website, however, remained operational and was
updated periodically. In late 1997, it was renamed <B>UFO: CINCINNATI!</B>
and continued as a forum for UFO-related news and information.</FONT></FONT></P>

<P><FONT FACE="ARIAL,HELVETICA"><FONT COLOR="#FFFF00">By May of 1998, the
site was averaging between 2,000 to 4,000 visitors daily, according to
internal Fuse 'transfer statistics.' The high traffic was thought to be
a problem and resulted in the acquisition of additional web-space on TRIPOD.
The additional space was to serve as a 'second site' to lessen the traffic
volume, and files were converted from one location to another. Frequently
slow TRIPOD, however, frustrated the readers with 'popups' that were widely
viewed as an annoyance.</FONT></FONT></P>

<P><FONT FACE="ARIAL,HELVETICA"><FONT COLOR="#FFFF00">Early this month
I thought it was time for a change in both URL locations and uploading
process. During the transition, I recognized some 'downtime' that I could
utilize to 'tweak and fine-tune' the site. Little did I realize how much
work was in store. Efforts to repair broken links, change color schemes
and update data was compounded by some disorganized files and storage systems.
It has taken more than one week to partially restore the site at the new
URL address, and it should be completed by late next-week <I>(please advise
if any broken images or links are located).</I></FONT></FONT></P>

<P><FONT FACE="ARIAL,HELVETICA"><FONT COLOR="#FFFF00">During this transition,
my E-mail address has also been changed, resulting in lost E-mail. Any
messages sent to the old address were cast into a void, and did not 'bounce'
until the following week. This was unanticipated. Please forgive the mixup
and let me know if I owe you a response.</FONT></FONT></P>

<P><FONT FACE="ARIAL,HELVETICA"><FONT COLOR="#FFFF00">I am also appreciative
of a number of phone calls to my home from some loyal visitors to the site
- people who did not leave their telephone numbers that would have allowed
me to call them back and explain.</FONT></FONT></P>

<P><FONT FACE="ARIAL,HELVETICA"><FONT COLOR="#FFFF00">The site is now back
up and running at the address listed below, and will continue to be a stable
source of objective UFO-related news and information originating from Cincinnati,
Ohio. </FONT></FONT></P>

<P><FONT FACE="ARIAL,HELVETICA"><FONT COLOR="#FFFF00">Coming soon to the
site will be the first in-depth interview with Larry Rogers and Curt Robinson,
authors of the book <B>&quot;Iceman Down.&quot;</B> Rogers and Robinson
claim to have blown the lid off of the mystery behind the famous Roswell,
New Mexico incident from 1947, and claim to have unearthed the TRUTH behind
the legendary UFO/crash controversy.</FONT></FONT></P>

<P><FONT FACE="ARIAL,HELVETICA"><FONT COLOR="#FFFF00">Please bookmark the
new URL location and apply the new e-mail address in your 'address books.'
Thanks for your patience</FONT></FONT></P>
