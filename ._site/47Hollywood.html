<p><font face="Lucida Console">Russell Long, North Hollywood, Cal., construction
engineer, found a 25-inch metal disc with radio tubes flashing and smoking
in his flower garden and excitedly called the fire department. "It looks
like someone went to a great deal of trouble for a joke," said battalion
chief Wallace E. Newcombe of the Los Angeles Fire Department.</font>

<p><font face="Lucida Console"><b>North Hollywood, Calif., July 10</b>
- A saucer-shaped mechanical contraption, resembling a chicken-brooder
top with a few gadgets added, was</font>
<br><font face="Lucida Console">found in a geranium bed at the home of
construction engineer Russell Long last night and the first official reaction
was from Fire Battalion Chief</font>
<br><font face="Lucida Console">Wallace E. Newcombe, who looked at it skeptically,
and said:</font>
<p><font face="Lucida Console">"It doesn't look to me like it could fly."</font>
<p><font face="Lucida Console">Long called the Van Nuys fire department
and excitedly pointed to the metal saucer, 30 inches in diameter, which
he said had been belching smoke from two exhaust pipes and emitting a blue-white
glare.</font>

<p><br><font face="Lucida Console">San Pedro, Cal., July 11 (U.P.) - Army
officers at Fort MacArthur took a look today at the "genuine, radio-controlled,
jet-propelled flying saucer" Russell Long found in his North Hollywood
garden and said it looked "like a gag."</font>
<p><font face="Lucida Console">"We don't think it could ever fly," an army
spokesman said. "However, we're holding the thing pending instructions
from 6th army headquarters."</font>
<p><font face="Lucida Console">Long still hoped to collect some of the
$3000 offered as rewards for a genuine flying disc, but his chances looked
pretty slim. The 10-pound iron disc dropped into his North Hollywood garden
two nights ago and knocked a couple of bricks off his house.</font>
