<p><b><font size=+3>Negro May Have The Disc Puzzle Answer</font></b>

Where there�s smoke, there�s fire. But where there�s smoke these days,
it may be a flying disc.
<p>That�s what a Negro in Limestone county discovered yesterday about 4
p.m. while he was plowing cotton on Bob Lewis� farm, near Beulah Bay. Harrison
Brown saw smoke rising from the field.
<p>Leaving his plow, Brown ran to the spot and saw what might well be the
first flying disc to be located in this area. Brown took the smoking �disc,�
about 1-inch in diameter, and submerged it in water.
<p>Later, after the stone had cooled, it was discovered that striking it
against cement produced a bluish flame. Constant striking, however, diminished
the stone�s size. Also, if this �flying disc� is set afire, it will continue
to smoke.
<p>Maybe this is the answer to the mystery which has evolved around the
flying discs seen the country over.
<p>Harrison Brown, though, has left his plow in the cotton fields.
<p>The Negro said he�s taking no chances of any hot stone falling down
his back.
