BGCOLOR="#081B2F"><b><font color="#FFFFFF"><u>Subject;</u> Interviewwith Franklin County (Indiana) EMT officer regarding incident of Aug. 9,2002</font></b><p><font color="#FFFFFF">This evening I reached Thomas (name changed, on-file),a volunteer Emergency Service Technician with the Franklin County EmergencyMedical Service Unit 2 at 15 West 5th Street in Brookville, Indiana (765-647-1265).Thomas spoke freely regarding the unusual event from Friday, August 9,but requested his name not be released in any report.</font><p><font color="#FFFFFF">Thomas, also a security guard for Dept. of Naturalresources, was on nightly patrol of the Brookville Lake campground whenhe heard notification over his police radio that Butler Cty., Ohio policeunits were informing of a low flying unidentified flying object (UFO) nearthe Bath, IN vicinity (a small town west of the campground near the stateline, situated east of Brookville Lake).</font><p><font color="#FFFFFF">"I was standing outside so I began looking forwhat they were reporting," he said, "when I then observed an object duewest from my vantage point.</font><p><font color="#FFFFFF">The emergency technician with the Franklin Countyvolunteer agency said that the object flew right over his head at an extremelylow elevation, yet he heard absolutely no noise. He described the objectas comprised of red lights situated in a triangle formation, spaced about6-feet apart.</font><p><font color="#FFFFFF">"This was like nothing I've ever seen," Thomassaid, "it was all red lights, no strobes,</font><p><font color="#FFFFFF">"I looked up to see the object, it flew rightover my head," the witness informed, "and it was completely undetectableby ear."</font><p><font color="#FFFFFF">Thomas said the object was so low that it hadbarely missed powerlines and was flying at treetop level. When pressedfurther on this, Thomas said the object flew at an estimated 25-feet abovethe height of a standard telephone pole and 'barely missing' treetops.</font><p><font color="#FFFFFF">The witness said that there was no visible moonduring the event and no backlit skies to see by.</font><p><font color="#FFFFFF">When asked more about the objects appearance,he explained that the solid red lights were not extremely bright and probablywould not be seen if at a higher elevation and positioned one in the frontand two in the rear. He could ascertain no physical structure to the object.</font><p><font color="#FFFFFF">"I don't believe it was very large," he said,"and if I had to estimate its length by the light spacing, I wouldn't saythis object was no more than 12-feet long."</font><p><font color="#FFFFFF">He then went on to remark about the silent operationof the object.</font><p><font color="#FFFFFF">"I absolutely didn't hear a thing," he said, "I'mhonestly not sure what it was. After some time when it got some distanceaway I could hear some kind of noise but it's hard to describe."</font><p><font color="#FFFFFF">"When it was off in the distance I could almosthear something that sounded like a rotor strut that pounded the air, butthis was not heard when it was right overhead."</font><p><font color="#FFFFFF">He feels positive that the distant thumping noisewas from the object.</font><p><font color="#FFFFFF">The object apparently undertook a course changeover the lake and headed off in a southwest direction.</font><p><font color="#FFFFFF">"Whatever this object was, it generated havocthroughout the campground," said the officer. "People were coming to thegate asking what it was."</font><p><font color="#FFFFFF">When asked if there were any animal reaction tothe object, he said that all kinds of dogs were around the area but theydid not behave unusual during the episode.</font><p><font color="#FFFFFF">Thomas said the staff in the area had been 'onedge' due to a helicopter crash around three weeks earlier</font><p><font color="#FFFFFF">Thomas acknowledges that he is the source forthe 'helicopter' speculation.</font><p><font color="#FFFFFF">"As far as a a helicopter explanation was concerned,that was an assumption made by me because I was the only emergency personnelto see this," he said. not confident that this was a helicopter</font><p><font color="#FFFFFF">"But I'm honestly not sure what it was, I wouldnot put any money on this being a helicopter."</font><p><font color="#FFFFFF">He said that he would not surprised if there wereother reports on this object. He was aware of reports generated near theOxford airport, which is directly due east of the campground.</font><p><font color="#FFFFFF">"Our dispatch was calling for an officer to investigatearea for low flying unidentified flying object," he said, "and I thinkit was called in from Butler County, Ohio."</font><p><font color="#FFFFFF">When told that another police agency offered thepossibility that this was a star cluster, he said: "this absolutely representednothing of a star cluster."</font><p><font color="#FFFFFF">Filed,</font><br><font color="#FFFFFF">AUGUST 14, 2002</font><br><font color="#FFFFFF">KENNY YOUNG</font><br><font color="#FFFFFF">--</font><br><font color="#FFFFFF">UFO Research</font><br><font color="#FFFFFF"><a href="https://home.fuse.net/ufo">https://home.fuse.net/ufo</a></font></td></tr></table></center><center><b><font color="#FFEA18"><a href="mailto:anomalyresponse@gmail.com">E-mail questionsor comments</a>&nbsp; |&nbsp; <a href="https://home.fuse.net/ufo">Returnto MAIN PAGE</a></font></b><br><b><font color="#FFEA18"><font size=-1>Website designed by Kenny Young|&nbsp; &copy;2003 All Rights Reserved</font></font></b><br><b><i><font color="#FFEA18"><font size=-1>This page created on March2, 2003</font></font></i></b></center></body></html>
