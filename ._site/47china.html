Chengtu, July 21 --- A flying disc was discovered to have fallen on the
Hwayangshiang Village on the outskirts of Chengtu on July 18. Someone picked
it up and sent it to the Szechuan University for examination. The disc
is found to be a transparent square box with two layers which are equipped
with simple devices. Attached to the box is a trumpet shaped like a bushel.
The back of the box has four tapes attached to it.
<p>The head of the College of Science of the University, Mr. Chang, told
our reporter that the alleged flying disc is in fact a high altitude atmospheric
barometer which is used in aviation. The four tapes attached to the box
are tied to the balloon for recording atmospheric conditions. A lable �Made
in U.S.A.� written in English was found on the box. However, where it came
from is unknown.

Air Defense Headquarters in Nanking also received reports from its three
observatories, stating that such a thing was seen in the same evening.
