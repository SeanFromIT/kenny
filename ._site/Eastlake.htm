<P><FONT COLOR="#FFFF00"><FONT SIZE=-1>They keep it in the &quot;Classics
File&quot; at the Coast Guard's 9th District Headquarters downtown: a single-page
incident report issued by the Fairport Harbor station on the night of March
4, 1988. The subject: Unidentified Flying Objects.</FONT></FONT></P>

<P><FONT COLOR="#FFFF00"><FONT SIZE=-1>&quot;None of those guys are around
anymore and I wasn't there,&quot; says Chief Quartermaster Leo Deon of
the Search and Rescue Data Section. &quot;They saw something, but who knows
what.&quot;</FONT></FONT></P>

<P><FONT COLOR="#FFFF00"><FONT SIZE=-1>Sgt. Greg Reid was the executive
officer at the Fairport station before he retired and joined the Lake County
Sheriff's Department.</FONT></FONT></P>

<P><FONT COLOR="#FFFF00"><FONT SIZE=-1>&quot;I believe my guys,&quot; he
says. &quot;They were definitely sure of what they saw.&quot;</FONT></FONT></P>

<P><FONT COLOR="#FFFF00"><FONT SIZE=-1>Sheila Baker sits in her kitchen,
sunlight streaming through the windows, a black, prune-faced Shar-Pei snoring
on the floor.</FONT></FONT></P>

<P><FONT COLOR="#FFFF00"><FONT SIZE=-1>&quot;I'm a typical Jewish mother
with three kids,&quot; she says. &quot;I go to temple. I believe in God.&quot;</FONT></FONT></P>

<P><FONT COLOR="#FFFF00"><FONT SIZE=-1>She fingers her ponytail. Then leans
forward.</FONT></FONT></P>

<P><FONT COLOR="#FFFF00"><FONT SIZE=-1>&quot;I know,&quot; she says. &quot;I
saw it.&quot;</FONT></FONT></P>

<P><FONT COLOR="#FFFF00"><FONT SIZE=-1>Friday, March 4, 1988, started cold
and got colder. There were light snow flurries throughout the day, but
by the time the sun set at 6:21 the clouds had broken up and the night
sky was clear and star-studded.</FONT></FONT></P>

<P><FONT COLOR="#FFFF00"><FONT SIZE=-1>Sheila Baker and her husband, Henry,
drove north along Ohio 91 into Eastlake and then turned east on Lake Shore
Boulevard. They had taken the kids to Chuck E. Cheese for dinner and were
almost home. As they neared the lake, they saw the blink of red warning
lights on the two smokestacks that towered over the CEI plant.</FONT></FONT></P>

<P><FONT COLOR="#FFFF00"><FONT SIZE=-1>Sheila liked the lights, the way
they rose 500, 600 feet straight up those cement chimneys like the fins
on a rocket ship. But tonight they looked different. The kids noticed it,
too. At first Sheila thought some of the lights had burned out. But as
they drove closer she could make out a shape. Something in the air. Out
over the lake. Motionless.</FONT></FONT></P>

<P><FONT COLOR="#FFFF00"><FONT SIZE=-1>&quot;There's something out there,&quot;
she said to Henry. &quot;See, over by the stacks.&quot;</FONT></FONT></P>

<P><FONT COLOR="#FFFF00"><FONT SIZE=-1>Henry couldn't see anything. &quot;You're
pregnant,&quot; he said. &quot;You're probably hallucinating.&quot;</FONT></FONT></P>

<P><FONT COLOR="#FFFF00"><FONT SIZE=-1>Sheila was thinking it could be
the Goodyear blimp. It kind of looked like a football. But what would the
Goodyear blimp be doing out on a night like this?</FONT></FONT><IMG SRC="Eastlake.jpg" HEIGHT=261 WIDTH=258 ALIGN=LEFT></P>

<P><FONT COLOR="#FFFF00"><FONT SIZE=-1>&quot;Go down to the beach,&quot;
she told Henry. &quot;I wanna take a look.&quot;</FONT></FONT></P>

<P><FONT COLOR="#FFFF00"><FONT SIZE=-1>Instead of arguing, Henry passed
their house on Hiawatha and drove down the hill to the beach. He parked
at the base of a wide ridge that climbed some 30 feet in front of them,
dirt and chunks of concrete that acted as a breakwall.</FONT></FONT></P>

<P><FONT COLOR="#FFFF00"><FONT SIZE=-1>A well-worn path led around it to
a small, sandy beach that curled into a corner at the feet of the two smokestacks.</FONT></FONT></P>

<P><FONT COLOR="#FFFF00"><FONT SIZE=-1>Sheila got out of the car.</FONT></FONT></P>

<P><FONT COLOR="#FFFF00"><FONT SIZE=-1>The moon was bright and full, and
the ice on the lake looked eerie. Sheila could hear it cracking. Loud.
Like claps of thunder. In between the claps, nothing. A dead calm. Not
even a dog barking. Everybody around here had a dog and one of them was
always barking.</FONT></FONT></P>

<P><FONT COLOR="#FFFF00"><FONT SIZE=-1>&quot;That's weird,&quot; Sheila
thought, reaching the beach, the night sky bursting above her, limitless,
going up and up and up, and there it was. The Goodyear blimp times 10.
But without the cabin underneath it. This thing was slick. A football the
size of a football field. Gunmetal gray. Blinding white light poured out
of both ends, but the thing itself made no noise, the ice beneath it grinding
and exploding like a string of M-80s.</FONT></FONT></P>

<P><FONT COLOR="#FFFF00"><FONT SIZE=-1>Sheila figured it was about a quarter-mile
above her, just off shore. It rocked back and forth like a teeter-totter.
She knew what it was. She read the Weekly World News. She saw &quot;Close
Encounters of the Third Kind.&quot; But she didn't believe it. It couldn't
be real, and yet there it was, moving now, one end swinging ponderously
toward shore, dipping down, closer and closer toward her.</FONT></FONT></P>

<P><FONT COLOR="#FFFF00"><FONT SIZE=-1>Sheila started running and she ran
right into Henry, who swore and started running, too. They beat it back
to the car like a couple of hicks in a Martian movie. Henry hit the gas.
Sheila locked the doors and told the kids to get down.</FONT></FONT></P>

<P><FONT COLOR="#FFFF00"><FONT SIZE=-1>&quot;You don't think they're going
to come and get us?&quot; Sheila asked.</FONT></FONT></P>

<P><FONT COLOR="#FFFF00"><FONT SIZE=-1>Henry was oblivious. &quot;Wow,&quot;
he said. &quot;This is great. I'm gonna get the binoculars.&quot;</FONT></FONT></P>

<P><FONT COLOR="#FFFF00"><FONT SIZE=-1>Three minutes later, Sheila had
hustled the kids out of the car and into the back bedroom. She opened the
closet door.</FONT></FONT></P>

<P><FONT COLOR="#FFFF00"><FONT SIZE=-1>&quot;Get in there,&quot; she said
and shut the door before they could argue. She pulled down all the window
blinds, turned off the lights and locked the bedroom door. Then she walked
into the living room.</FONT></FONT></P>

<P><FONT COLOR="#FFFF00"><FONT SIZE=-1>Henry was standing by the window
that faced the lake. The object had moved out over the ice. It seemed to
be descending. Red and blue lights were now flashing sequentially along
its lower edge. Sheila picked up the phone and called the Eastlake police.</FONT></FONT></P>

<P><FONT COLOR="#FFFF00"><FONT SIZE=-1>&quot;I want to report a UFO,&quot;
she told the cop who answered.</FONT></FONT></P>

<P><FONT COLOR="#FFFF00"><FONT SIZE=-1>He seemed insulted.</FONT></FONT></P>

<P><FONT COLOR="#FFFF00"><FONT SIZE=-1>&quot;There's something out there,&quot;
she said. &quot;I'm watching it now.&quot;</FONT></FONT></P>

<P><FONT COLOR="#FFFF00"><FONT SIZE=-1>He told her to call Lost Nation
Airport in Willoughby. Probably an advertising plane, a helicopter. Sheila
called the airport. They guy in the tower told her they had nothing taking
off or landing. She asked if there were any weird blips on his radar screen.
He said no. He figured maybe it was the planets, Venus and Jupiter. She
should call NASA.</FONT></FONT></P>

<P><FONT COLOR="#FFFF00"><FONT SIZE=-1>All the time Sheila was watching
it. It was about five miles out now, still descending, red and blue lights
flashing as if it was going to crash. She called the cops back. They told
her unusual activity over the lake was the responsibility of the Coast
Guard. Sheila called Fairport Harbor. They suggested Wright-Patterson Air
Force Base.</FONT></FONT></P>

<P><FONT COLOR="#FFFF00"><FONT SIZE=-1>&quot;Everybody thinks I'm nuts,&quot;
she told Henry.</FONT></FONT></P>

<P><FONT COLOR="#FFFF00"><FONT SIZE=-1>Suddenly a series of bright triangular
yellow lights shot out of the center of the object. These triangles, there
were five or six of them, it was hard to count they moved so quickly, looked
about the size of a single-seat Cessna. They hovered point-up around the
object. Then darted north, then east, heading inland toward the Perry nuclear
power plant. Sheila had never seen anything move that fast. Zero to warp-
speed in less than a nanosecond. Without making a sound. She called the
Coast Guard again. This time, they said they were sending a crew by the
house. Sheila let her kids out of the closet, but made them stay in the
bedroom with the doors locked.</FONT></FONT></P>

<P><FONT COLOR="#FFFF00"><FONT SIZE=-1>Mobile Unit 2 was a 1984 blue Chevy
Suburban and the two guys in it were gung-ho. Seaman James Powers and Petty
Officer John Knaub said they could see the lights from Fairport Harbor.
They figured they were flares. Fishermen trapped out on the ice, that kind
of thing. They were towing a 22-foot Boston Whaler just in case.</FONT></FONT></P>

<P><FONT COLOR="#FFFF00"><FONT SIZE=-1>Sheila and Henry pointed to the
object they now thought of as the mother ship. A couple of the triangles
were zipping around it. Powers and Knaub didn't say a word. Instead of
driving onto the beach, they four-wheeled the Chevy up the ridge. The ice
was going nuts, rippling and rumbling and roaring. Sheila and Henry got
out. The windows were down and they could hear Knaub and Powers talking
to the base.</FONT></FONT></P>

<P><FONT COLOR="#FFFF00"><FONT SIZE=-1>&quot;Be advised the object appears
to be landing on the lake,&quot; they said. &quot;Be advised there are
other objects moving in around it. Be advised these smaller objects are
going at high rates of speed. There are no engine noises and they are very,
very low. Be advised these are not planets.&quot;</FONT></FONT></P>

<P><FONT COLOR="#FFFF00"><FONT SIZE=-1>All of a sudden one of the triangles
zoomed toward the Chevy, low, just above the ice, a blur of light blistering
straight at them. Knaub quickly rolled the van back down the ridge. The
triangle veered east, then went straight up and came down beside the mother
ship. Sheila told Knaub to turn his lights off.</FONT></FONT></P>

<P><FONT COLOR="#FFFF00"><FONT SIZE=-1>&quot;Why attract attention?&quot;
she asked.</FONT></FONT></P>

<P><FONT COLOR="#FFFF00"><FONT SIZE=-1>Fifteen miles to the southeast,
not too far from the Perry plant, Cindy Hale stepped outside to walk her
dog. She noticed a triangular light hovering above her. The dog began to
whine and cower. Cindy took it back inside. But she came out again. The
triangle flashed a sequence of multicolored lights and Cindy responded
by flicking her Bic. This went on for about 30 minutes, then the triangle
accelerated and was gone. It didn't make a sound.</FONT></FONT></P>

<P><FONT COLOR="#FFFF00"><FONT SIZE=-1>Tim Keck was observing the stars
through his telescopte when a bright triangular object caught his eye.
Luckily, Tim had his camera with him. It wasn't a great camera. In fact,
it was a little plastic number he had gotten free from Burger King. But
it worked, and he took a picture of the triangle before it disappeared
silently over the horizon.</FONT></FONT></P>

<P><FONT COLOR="#FFFF00"><FONT SIZE=-1>Back at the lake, the mother ship
was almost on the ice. For an hour, Henry had stood on the ridge and listened
as Powers and Knaub communicated with their base. They said things like,
&quot;You should be advised that the object is now shining lights all over
the lake and turning different colors.&quot;</FONT></FONT></P>

<P><FONT COLOR="#FFFF00"><FONT SIZE=-1>The ice thundered. Powers and Knaub
had to yell to be heard. Henry thought the big ship was in trouble. So
did Sheila. She had gone back to the house. The kids were still locked
in the bedroom and she watched from the window. Suddenly the triangles
were back. They shot one by one intot the side of the mother ship as it
seemed to set down on the howling ice.</FONT></FONT></P>

<P><FONT COLOR="#FFFF00"><FONT SIZE=-1>It flashed a sequence of red, blue
and yellow lights. Sheila thought they looked beautiful. Then the white
light that poured from the front of the object turned red and the triangles
reappeared, hovering over it. The ice boomed, louder and louder, and then
suddenly it stopped. The lights disappeared. So did the triangles. Now
there was nothing. Darkness and silence.</FONT></FONT></P>

<P><FONT COLOR="#FFFF00"><FONT SIZE=-1>Powers and Knaub drove off white-faced.
Sheila and Henry stood watch through the night. In the morning all that
remained were scattered chunks of broken ice. But that evening, the triangles
returned.</FONT></FONT></P>

<P><FONT COLOR="#FFFF00"><FONT SIZE=-1>Sheila called the Coast Guard. This
time they sent three people. But they arrived to late and the triangles
were gone. To reassure the Bakers, they called Lost Nation Airport and
talked to Elizabeth Mele in the control tower, who told them the two bright
lights in the sky were Venus and Jupiter, and the flashing lights were
gases in the atmosphere.</FONT></FONT></P>

<P><FONT COLOR="#FFFF00"><FONT SIZE=-1>That was Saturday. On Monday, The
Plain Dealer ran a short item headlined &quot;Cozying of Jupiter, Venus
light up sky.&quot; The Lake County News-Herald ran a similar version with
the caption &quot;Sky-gazers mistake planets for UFOs.&quot;</FONT></FONT></P>

<P><FONT COLOR="#FFFF00"><FONT SIZE=-1>Sheila called Fairport Harbor. Powers
and Knaub weren't there. She left a message. They didn't call back. She
called again and again and again. Nothing.</FONT></FONT></P>

<P><FONT COLOR="#FFFF00"><FONT SIZE=-1>Four years later, she's still confused.</FONT></FONT></P>

<P><FONT COLOR="#FFFF00"><FONT SIZE=-1>&quot;The government flat-out denies
it happened and I was standing there with two government employees watching
it and they saw it and then they disappear.&quot;</FONT></FONT></P>

<P><FONT COLOR="#FFFF00"><FONT SIZE=-1>Chief Leo Deon said the Coast Guard
had no official policy in regard to UFOs, and since there were no more
sightings that was the end of it. All personnel assigned to Fairport Harbor
in 1988 have been rotated out. Deon said he couldn't located Powers, who
had left the service, or Knaub through personnel records, because those
records had been archived in Washington.</FONT></FONT></P>

<P><FONT COLOR="#FFFF00"><FONT SIZE=-1>&quot;It was big around the station
for a while,&quot; says retired executive officer Greg Reid. &quot;Then
it just fizzled out.&quot;</FONT></FONT></P>

<P><FONT COLOR="#FFFF00"><FONT SIZE=-1>Sheila Baker frowns and points a
finger.</FONT></FONT></P>

<P><FONT COLOR="#FFFF00"><FONT SIZE=-1>&quot;You start to worry,&quot;
she says. </FONT></FONT></P>

The triangle was so large and moving so fast, that he captured only half
of it. Dr. Bruce Maccabee, an optical physicist for the U.S. Navy, analyzed
the photograph and determined it was not a hoax. What it was, he couldn't

From: RICHARD P. DELL'AQUILA (ab114) <BR>
Subj: EASTLAKE UFO REPORTED BY COAST GUARD </FONT></I></P>

<P><I><FONT COLOR="#00FF00">In a reply to a recent question from Dale Wedge,
Page Stevens has mentioned that an unusual UFO event occurring over Lake
Erie in early March was the result of a misidentification of the planets
Jupiter and Venus which appeared close to each other in the night sky.
</FONT></I></P>

<P><I><FONT COLOR="#00FF00">Page mentioned that a Coast Guard report on
the incident &quot;agrees fully&quot; with the Venus/Jupiter hypothesis.
The report has been submitted to an astronomer for his expert opinion as
to whether the Venus/Jupiter hypothesis adequately explains all the phenomena
described in the report by the Coast Guard personnel, also reported by
at least a half dozen other independent witnesses. </FONT></I></P>

<P><I><FONT COLOR="#00FF00">The sightings, which have continued unabated
for the past month, have been reported by several independent witnesses,
one of whom took photographs. The case is being investigated by Rick Dell'Aquila
(ab114) and Dale Wedge (ae511) </FONT></I></P>

<P><I><FONT COLOR="#00FF00">The document confirms that members of the Coast
Guard saw a group of strange objects cavorting on and near the icy surface
of Lake Erie. A local astronomer attempted to explain the sightings as
resulting from the apparent conjunction of Jupiter and Venus in the night
sky, coupled with &quot;spontaneous gas emissions&quot; caused by viewing
the conjunction through the Earth's atmosphere. </FONT></I></P>

<P><I><FONT COLOR="#00FF00">The incident involves large blimp-like object,
&quot;larger than the Goodyear blimp,&quot; which released up to a half
dozen triangular-shaped lights and objects, in close proximity to the Perry
nuclear power plant and Eastlake coal burng plant, and multiple independent
witnesses, apparent animal reactions, as well as government documents,
and hence qualifies for high- priority. The case is officially classified
as a Close Encounter of the Second Kind. </FONT></I></P>

<P><I><FONT COLOR="#00FF00">The Coast Guard report for the following evening
suggests that the Coast Guard had misidentified the planets Jupiter and
Venus. I ask the astronomers on this board, skeptical or otherwise, for
their opinions as to the adequacy of the Venus/ Jupiter hypothesis in light
of this report. Page, I ask you whether the foregoing report &quot;fully
agrees&quot; with the Venus/Jupiter hypothesis, and also whether you believe
that these Coast Guard personnel, experts in their own way and no doubt
familiar with the night sky and celestial navigation, could have so grossly
misidentified the planets for several hours.</FONT></I></P>

<P><FONT COLOR="#FF8000">Date: Mon Apr 11 21:47:08 1988 <BR>
From: RICHARD P. DELL'AQUILA (ab114) <BR>
Subj: TO THE ASTRONOMERS <BR>
RE: EASTLAKE UFO </FONT></P>

<P><FONT COLOR="#FF8000">AN OPEN LETTER TO THE PROFESSIONAL SKEPTICS, RE:
UFO SIGHTING OVER LAKE ERIE OVER THE WEEKEND OF MARCH 4, 1988 </FONT></P>

<P><FONT COLOR="#FF8000">It is understandable that a professional in any
occupation will have a reputation to preserve among is or her peers, and
that the desire to maintain that professional reputation will sometimes
require the professional to defend indefensable positions (e.g. &quot;C.Y.A.&quot;)
from which he cannot otherwise extricate himself. It's okay guys, I understand.
You out the Venus/Jupiter hypothesis before the Coast Guard report was
released and now you are stuck with it for better or worse. </FONT></P>

<P><FONT COLOR="#FF8000">I suspect that, being the professionals you are,
and given the natural curiosity which is the sine quo non of the true scientist,
your real opinions are very different than those you publicly express.
Anyway, for the rest of us who remain willing to fairly examine ALL the
reported phenomena and express our true opinions, it is now apparent that
the professional skeptics on this SIG have so commmitted themselves to
their position that the Eastlake UFO sighting of March 1988 was a misidentification
of the planets, that it is almost laughable to expect any thinking individual,
who has read the Coast Guard report of the sighting, to accept the Venus/Jupiter
hypothesis. </FONT></P>

<P><FONT COLOR="#FF8000">Frankly, a more honest response would have been
a simple, &quot;I don't know what the Coast Guard saw that night for 3-4
hours, it could have been Venus/Jupiter.&quot; </FONT></P>

<P><FONT COLOR="#FF8000">But at least you had the fortitude to respond.
</FONT></P>

<P><FONT COLOR="#FF8000">It is important that the subject of UFOs be discussed
openly without emotionalism or hysterics. After all, we are free to disagree,
hopefully in a civil manner. I suppose yours is at least a more straightforward
approach than that taken by the sysop of another Freenet SIG who, after
inviting UFO discussion, has elected to erase all UFO uploads from his
SIG and who, when all else fails, resorts to name-calling as a torical
device. </FONT></P>

<P><FONT COLOR="#FF8000">Well, taking your toys home when you lose the
game is a rather immature way to deal with confrontation. Doctor, take
an example from the skeptics on this SIG, bravely sticking to their guns--going
down with their ship, flags waving--but proudly, stubbornly, sticking to
their guns to the bitter end. &quot;Solution: Venus/Jupiter&quot; period.
Guys: You are the experts. People look to you for answers. If you teach,
your students rely on you for accuracy. When you publish, other experts
rely on your objectivity and clarity of analysis. Yet you ask us to accept
the Venus/Jupiter hypothesis primarily because you have put it forward
as the &quot;truth.&quot; </FONT></P>

<P><FONT COLOR="#FF8000">Now that the professional skeptics have made their
final pronouncement, I trust you will permit me to raise a few minor details,
tie up some loose ends and send along you ways to comfortably bury our
heads back in the sand again until the next time the planets start releasing
strobing multi-colored triagular UFOs 20 feet over the surface of Lake
Erie that cross distances of several miles in a few seconds, cast spotlights,
and scare the wits out of U.S. military personnel for several hours. </FONT></P>

<P><FONT COLOR="#FF8000">At least when the next UFO comes along, the handy-dandy
Venus/Jupiter explanation (or something similar) will be ready to go. By
the way, what an insult to the Coast Guard. Apparently, according to the
skeptical &quot;experts&quot;, their men are not capable of distinguishing
the planets in the night sky--even after several hours of observation.
Fair enough, but don't expect any Christmas cards from the Coast Guard,
guys! (No loss--they probably can't write either.) </FONT></P>

<P><FONT COLOR="#FF8000">At any rate, at least you haven't run away and
hid when things got a little rough. You proud graduates of the Phil Klass
School of Skeptical Technique have recognized that the first requirement
of a skeptic is to remain skeptical: to sift through the evidence, only
emphasizing those facts that can be made to support your hypothesis and
ignoring the &quot;meaningless residue&quot; for purposes of clarity. However,
the a priori assumption with which you approach this particular subject
(i.e. &quot;UFOs do not represent any phenomena which cannot be explained
in prosaic terms.&quot;) renders your resulting opinions on the matter
largely irrelevant. </FONT></P>

<P><FONT COLOR="#FF8000">Although your credentials as Skeptics remain firmly
intact, be honest enough to admit you cannot adequately explain ALL aspects
of the sighting. Don't push sophistry. </FONT></P>

<P><FONT COLOR="#FF8000">I respectfully suggest that the Venus/Jupiter
hypothesis is a professional embarassment to you, since it completely ignores
the observed phenomena and fails to explain how the Coast Guard personnel
could have been so grossly fooled by known celestial objects. </FONT></P>

<P><FONT COLOR="#FF8000">Guys, it's okay to admit you just &quot;don't

<P><I><FONT COLOR="#00FFFF">During he first week of last month the very
bright planets Venus and Jupiter were positioned very close together in
the western sky for several hours after sunset.As has happened many times
in the past,this resulted in many people calling the newspapers,TV stations,the
astronomy dept. at CWRU,etc. to report these objects as UFOs. In an April
7 listing on this bulletin board,Rick Dell'Aquila gives the text of a U.S.Coast
Guard report (dated March 4) which he suggests can not be explained as
resulting from a misidentification of these planets.Although it contains
an account of multi-colored, noctural lights cavoring about and landing
on the Lake Erie ice, this report is devoid of the most important observational
details which one expects from highly trained observers.What was their
exact location at the time of these observations? Given that location,what
were the approximate azimuth and altitude of these lights? Since the shoreline
at Fairport Harbor runs almost NE-SW, saying that the lights are out over
the lake means that they could lie anywhere from SE to NW as seen from
near the lakeshore. Given this lack of detail, it is rather suggestive
that the CG people observed the bright light to &quot;land&quot; on the
ice at about the same time that Venus set i.e. went below the horizon that
evening. Nowhere in the report do the CG people say that they saw the UFOs
in addition to Venus and Jupiter i.e. if this display took place low in
the westen sky,one might expect them to have compared the brightness and
positions of the UFOs relative to these planets. It is therefore most likely
that they were indeed observing these planets only. Because Venus was very
low in the sky, the multi-color effects reported could result from atmospheric
scintillation.The PD reporter apparently misunderstood this phenomenon
and used the phrase &quot;spontaneous gaseous emissions which of course
is non-sense. It is my understanding that a UFO sighting can only be assigned
to the CE II category if it leaves behind some form of physical evidence,e.g.
a burned patch of grass,etc. I suppose this report is being given CE II
status because of the reported sound of the lake ice cracking under the
weight of the landed UFO. A more likely explanation for that aspect of
this event is the arrival of spring. </FONT></I></P>
