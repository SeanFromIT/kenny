As they just crossed the old covered bridge,coming from Route 50 and heading north, they reported seeing an orangish-redlight the size of a softball. The light travelled at a height comparableto that of the hood of their car. The object approached from the front,went straight at them, and went around the car on the drivers side. Thedriver, Mike XXXXX, hit the brakes and jumped out of car, and Shannon objectedto his brother getting out. Both witnesses were excited. Object was perfectlysilent, and visible for just a few seconds (3 to 5). It departed from viewas it continued on travelling the opposite direction along the highway,still at the same elevation.&nbsp;</font><font color="#000000"></font><p><font color="#000000">Weather Conditions: Moon visible, clear sky, temperaturewarm.

Given my impression of the witness credibility,I am inclined to suspect that there may be no immediate explanation availablefor the glowing softball-sized object which reportedly 'weaved' aroundhis automobile.&nbsp;</font><font color="#000000"></font><p><font color="#000000">Report filed:<br>August 21, 1997&nbsp;</font><br><font color="#000000">Kenny Young&nbsp;</font><font color="#000000"></font><p><hr WIDTH="100%"><font color="#000000"></font><p><i><font color="#000000">The witness, interviewed by researchers RonSchaffner, Kenny Young and Greg Deye on Sunday, September 1, 1997, he posedfor photographs to motion in the direction where he claims the small glowingobject first appeared before circling evasively around his car. The objectwas said to be a 'red ball of light.'&nbsp;<br><br>During this investigation, Ron Schaffner located charred wood fragments,indicating a fire which had been ignited previously in the immediate vicinityof the event.

Given its small size, low altitude, and confrontationaldemeanor, it reminds me of some of the "ghostlight" cases we investigatedyears ago. It would be interesting to determine if that particular roador region has had similar occurrences over the years (a characteristicof these strange nocturnal lights is to "haunt" the same locale repeatedlyover a long period of time).&nbsp;</font><font color="#000000"></font><p><font color="#000000">Regarding weather conditions, it seems that inthe vast majority of cases on record, storm activity seemed to be a prerequisitefor ball lightning activity.&nbsp;</font><font color="#000000"></font><p><font color="#000000">In many cases ball lightning has been silent orhas produced a static crackle or hum. However, while it is relatively quietin its travels, it tends to extinguish itself with an explosive report.Another point to consider here is that ball lightning is an extremely short-livedphenomenon, generally having a "lifespan" ranging from a few seconds toa minute or two at most.&nbsp;</font><font color="#000000"></font><p><font color="#000000">Witnesses have often described ball lightningas exhibiting a "behaviour" in that it displays inquisitiveness, playfulness,and is most deliberate in its actions. These qualities have been long speculatedupon as nothing more than wildly fluctuating electrostatic charges inducingthe plasma to perform a variety of unusual movements depending on whatlike and unlike charges it encounters during its brief lifetime. Who knows...?&nbsp;</font><font color="#000000"></font><p><font color="#000000">One of the best sources of ball lightning informationand case histories is the Handbook of Unusual Natural Phenomena by WilliamCorliss. I highly recommend it.&nbsp;</font><font color="#000000"></font><p><hr WIDTH="100%"><b><font color="#000000"><font size=+1></font></font></b><p><b><font color="#000000"><font size=+1>BALL LIGHTNING?&nbsp;<br>by Terry Endres, T.A.S.K. Director and A.R.C. Commentator</font></font></b><b><font color="#000000"><font size=+1></font></font></b><p><font color="#000000">Ball lightning is a plausible explanation to accountfor the CLERMONT COUNTY report. However, upon further exploration, we havea number of good reasons to reject this explanation.&nbsp;</font><font color="#000000"></font><p><font color="#000000">1. Weather conditions, said to be clear with moonvisible. Although some speculate that ball lightning can materialize anywhere,how do we know for certain that the nature and properties of ball lightningwould be such that it could form on a warm, clear night and travel, withpath, low to ground?&nbsp;</font><font color="#000000"></font><p><font color="#000000">2. Apparent lack of sound: It is often said thatball lightning is accompanied by a strong, static-like crackle of soundwhile visible.&nbsp;</font><font color="#000000"></font><p><font color="#000000">3. EVAVISE CONDUCT: alleged glowing light circledcar and resumed initial path above road. This seems to indicate controlledflight&nbsp;</font><font color="#000000"></font><p><font color="#000000">Ball Lightning Analysis&nbsp;</font><br><font color="#000000">If ball lightning is dependent on static electriccharge, then an apparent storm is not required. If this area is also closeto high voltage power lines, coronal discharge could generate enough energyto produce a "ball lightning" episode (St. Elmo's fire). This might alsobe a case in support of the Earth Light hypothesis, wherein geologic activitymight produce a plasma discharge [earthquake lights].&nbsp;</font><font color="#000000"></font><p><font color="#000000">While there may be a crackling sound associatedwith ball lightning, its volume would probably depend on the actual voltageof the discharge. Also, hearing this "sizzle" depends on witness proximityand if the wind is blowing the right way. Also, witnesses were in a car.If driving with windows up and air conditioning on, the sizzle would notbe heard. If windows down, wind could have masked the sound. Witnessesexited the car after its evasive motion and when it was probably too faraway to be heard.&nbsp;</font><font color="#000000"></font><p><font color="#000000">The evasive conduct reported may be due to polarityof charge being the same as the magnetic field generated by the car's powersystems. As to why the object followed the road, there may be two possibilities:&nbsp;</font><font color="#000000"></font><p><font color="#000000">A. It was not running parallel to the road butparallel to the telephone/electric linesï¿½along side the road.&nbsp;</font><font color="#000000"></font><p><font color="#000000">B. If the road has ever been paved of concrete,the rebar [steel reinforcing] might serve to "conduct" the discharge alongthe road.&nbsp;</font><font color="#000000"></font><p><font color="#000000">I vote for "ball lightning."&nbsp;</font><font color="#000000"></font><p><hr WIDTH="100%"><font color="#000000"></font><p><b><font color="#000000">FURTHER DISCUSSION AND DISAGREEMENT<br>by Dale Farmer</font></b><br><font color="#000000"></font>&nbsp;<font color="#000000"></font><p><font color="#000000">Terry, I totally disagree with this explanation!&nbsp;</font><font color="#000000"></font><p><font color="#000000">First of all what, geological activity took placein Clermont County? It would have to be a big one to produce ball lightning.Even with that there is really no hard core proof that relates geologicalactivity to ball lightning. Secondly, there was another message relatingthat the ball followed the road either because of transmission lines followingthe road or steel reinforcement under the road. I would like to know whattype of road it is made of . Not all road have steel reinforcements especiallyif it is a back road (county road). I think their has to be a better explanationto this.&nbsp;</font><br><br><hr WIDTH="100%"><br><b><font color="#000000">MORE DISCUSSION&nbsp;</font></b><br><BR><br><font color="#000000">More reasons to say NO to ball lightning...&nbsp;</font><font color="#000000"></font><p><font color="#000000">1) Ball lightning is most often associated withthunderstorms. Non-thunderstorm ball-lightning-like phenomena has occurredwith high voltage electrical equipment.&nbsp;</font><font color="#000000"></font><p><font color="#000000">2) Most occurrences of ball lightning are accompaniedwith a simultaneous cloud-to-ground discharge.&nbsp;</font><font color="#000000"></font><p><font color="#000000">3) Occasionally, ball lightning has been reportedto act as though it is guided by intelligence. There have been severalreports of people being chased by it.&nbsp;</font><font color="#000000"></font><p><font color="#000000">4) Ball lightning usually moves very swiftly andhas a lifetime of less than 5 sec. Although there have been exceptions:many reports in which it is stationary; some reports of 1 min. duration.&nbsp;</font><font color="#000000"></font><p><font color="#000000">5) Also, while ball lightning can move downwardand horizontally, it almost never moves upward.&nbsp;</font><font color="#000000"></font><p><font color="#000000">6) Ball lightning has been observed in severaldifferent colors -- most common is a reddish hue.&nbsp;</font><font color="#000000"></font><p><font color="#000000">7) It also is not uncommon for ball lightningto have an odor or sound.&nbsp;</font><font color="#000000"></font><p><hr WIDTH="100%"><br><br><b><font color="#000000"><font size=+2>Swamp Gas or "Corpse Candles?"&nbsp;</font></font></b><font color="#000000"></font><p><font color="#000000">The phenomenon called St. Elmo's Fire is certainlynot the culprit since it needs a conducting surface and a strong electricfield to produce visible effects. Earthquake lights are an unlikely causesince there is an absence of known tectonic activity in that area. Somethingsimilar to swamp gas may be the culprit behind the 'CLERMONT SCARE.'&nbsp;</font><font color="#000000"></font><p><font color="#000000">The 'swamp gas' term is used rather loosely here,and numerous other names have been suggested to account for similar phenomena:i.e. wil'o-the-wisp, corpse candles, spirit lights, bog lights, etc.&nbsp;</font><font color="#000000"></font><p><font color="#000000">There are numerous reasons for suggesting thisclassic, often used UFO explanation. First, the sighting(s) occurred neara covered bridge. There is a small creek/stream underneath the bridge.Also, the bridge is in the proximity of a cemetery. The presence of bothcorpses and water in this vicinity could indicate that there may be decomposingof organic material happening in this area. So, a presence of methane andhydrogen phosphide may cause a glowing flame. Moreover, there was an apparentlack of sound. Wil'o-the-wisps and bog lights are silent. It is not proven,but it seems to be the most logical explanation.&nbsp;</font><font color="#000000"></font><p><hr WIDTH="100%"><font color="#000000"></font><p><b><font color="#000000"><font size=+1>Urban Legends of The CoveredBridge Area&nbsp;</font></font></b><font color="#000000"></font><p><font color="#000000">A couple have parked their car on the darkenedbridge, shutting off the motor and turning out their lights. Shortly aftermidnight, the twosome enjoy a romantic interlude.&nbsp;</font><font color="#000000"></font><p><font color="#000000">Suddenly, the girl thinks she hears strange noisecoming from somewhere within or underneath the bridge. The boyfriend disagrees,and fearlessly announces that he's going out of the car to see what itis, despite her sincere objections.&nbsp;</font><font color="#000000"></font><p><font color="#000000">The girl waits alone while over an hour of horrifiedsilence passes. Then, breaking the terrorizing stillness, a set of headlightsappears in the darkness as another vehicle pulls up behind the car. Thefrightened girl shields her eyes from the blinding headlights as she listensto calm, steady footsteps approaching her car door. A firm male voice tellsher, "Get out of the car and no matter what you do, don't look back!"&nbsp;</font><font color="#000000"></font><p><font color="#000000">As it turns out, the visitor is a deputy sheriff.While walking to the police cruiser, the girl chances a concerned glancearound, despite the stern warning.
