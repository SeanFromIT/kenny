<P><FONT COLOR="#FFFF00"><FONT SIZE=+2>Flare Theory DISCREPANCY</FONT></FONT>
</P>

<P><FONT COLOR="#FFFF00"><FONT SIZE=-1>The following information is considered
KEY DETAIL regarding the March 26, 1997 happening over Southern Ohio. The
event, as you may recall, was dismissed by a Springfield, Ohio Air National
Guard Sergeant as being explainable as 'NIGHT INTERCEPT' training exercizes
using flares launched from eight F-16 A.N.G. jets that were in the area.</FONT></FONT></P>

<P><FONT COLOR="#FFFF00"><FONT SIZE=-1>At 9:45 p.m. on April 13, 1997,
a phone call was placed to New Vienna, Ohio, to speak with the Mayor of
New Vienna. The mayor acknowledged being a witness to the event on March
26, but added that he felt his wife could furnish more details.</FONT></FONT></P>

<P><FONT COLOR="#FFFF00"><FONT SIZE=-1>The Mayor's wife came to the phone
and sounded alert and very intelligent. She was very courteous and willingly
provided the following details regarding the objects she observed on March
26 around 8:00 p.m.</FONT></FONT></P>

<P><FONT COLOR="#FFFF00"><FONT SIZE=-1>The objects would 'disappear' from
one place and suddenly 'appear' from another. She added that there were
quite a few witnesses that she knew about. The objects, as she used the
term, made no noise. She added that they would be visible anywhere from
5 seconds to 5 minutes.</FONT></FONT></P>

<P><FONT COLOR="#FFFF00"><FONT SIZE=-1>She said that it was kind of cold
that evening, and she thought about getting her video camera, but thought
she would miss the action if she would have made the effort.</FONT></FONT></P>

<P><FONT COLOR="#FFFF00"><FONT SIZE=-1>She said, &quot;if I were to go
back in and get my video camera, I would miss it, so I just disregarded
it, but it lasted for a good 45-minutes, longer than I expected. You would
see the lights off and on. And then all of a sudden these four planes came
from the left of us and went heading toward the lights there. These planes
were flying so low, I had never seen anything like it before. I had talked
to my brother at 11 0'clock , we were watching the news... and his son
was standing outside with me, so we talked and my nephew said that he was
outside playing basketball after he left my house, and he saw something
drop from the sky and bounce back up off of the ground in that area.&quot;</FONT></FONT></P>

<P><FONT COLOR="#FFFF00"><FONT SIZE=-1>The witness went on to add, &quot;Other
people also saw this light drop from the sky and bounce back up, and the
word I had heard from someone at Airborne Express who I know was that 'these
planes were testing some kind of secret weapon,' or that they was using
some kind of secret missile, but whatever the case, the missile dropped,
hit the ground and distentegrated, and there was a hole in the ground between
Highland and Leesburgh on Underground Road. But they said the missile rose
back up into the sky again. I don't know if it was reported to the Sheriff's
department.&quot; </FONT></FONT></P>

<P><FONT COLOR="#FFFF00"><FONT SIZE=-1>The kind witness also recalled of
strange events happening in the area later that night. &quot;There were
helicopters flying around, more so than I've ever seen out here before.
The helicopters were circling around Route 28, and I've seen Airborne Express
and other planes out here a number of times, but these were helicopters,
and there were quite a few of them, and it seemed like they were looking
for something, I could speculate. I went driving after 11:00 p.m., and
that's when I saw them. I was driving north on 28, and they were everywhere.
I saw them and I heard them. I don't know what kind of helicopters they
were.&quot;</FONT></FONT></P>

<P><FONT COLOR="#FFFF00"><FONT SIZE=-1>At 10:30 p.m., a phone call was
made to an official with the New Vienna Fire and E.M.S. Rescue Service.
The witness was coherent, intelligent, and viewed by this investigator
to be credible and reliable, and freely discussed the March 26 incident.
He was contacted courtesy of assistance provided by the wife of the Mayor
of New Vienna, Ohio, who furnished information on his whereabouts.</FONT></FONT></P>

<P><FONT COLOR="#FFFF00"><FONT SIZE=-1>While travelling on Rt. 729, the
E.M.S. officer travelled to Route 72 and followed the bright lights that
were in the sky. He advised of hearing reports of 'Wright Patterson Air
Force Base doing some dog-fighting in the area. What follows are the comments
made by the E.M.S. official:</FONT></FONT></P>

<P><FONT COLOR="#FFFF00"><FONT SIZE=-1>&quot;Before it hit the ground there
were three triangle-type lights in order, not flashing... an exact pryamid
shape in the sky. There was one object behind the three that was flashing.
They looked like a large ball of light that kept getting brighter. You
wouldn't see it and then all of a sudden there it was again.&quot;</FONT></FONT></P>

<P><FONT COLOR="#FFFF00"><FONT SIZE=-1>&quot;We hunted for the area. It
was towards Greenfield and Hillsboro. Being on the fire department, I could
monitor the radio traffic and that's when I heard it was Wright Patterson
Air Force Base, but we could never find the area.&quot;</FONT></FONT></P>

<P><FONT COLOR="#FFFF00"><FONT SIZE=-1>The fire official further described
the event as follows: &quot;It just kept travelling real fast and went
straight down. We thought it was a shooting star at first, but it just
dropped and hit the ground, and went straight back up in the same way it
came down. There was no sound or flash or anything that we could see.&quot;</FONT></FONT></P>

<P><FONT COLOR="#FFFF00"><FONT SIZE=-1>When asked if there were planes
in the area, the fire official replied that there were.</FONT></FONT></P>

<P><FONT COLOR="#FFFF00"><FONT SIZE=-1>&quot;There were jets in the area,
and we would see something shoot out, which followed out for a little bit,
and it popped and exploded and more would come off of it, one would shoot
out for maybe 30 or 40 feet, and then two or three more would come off
of that.&quot;</FONT></FONT></P>

<P><FONT COLOR="#FFFF00"><FONT SIZE=-1>&quot;The one that dropped didn't
come out of any plane,&quot; the witness cautioned, &quot;that was really
weird. The three lights in the triangle shape were travelling east, with
the blinking light behind them, but that wasn't seen again.&quot; </FONT></FONT></P>

<P><FONT COLOR="#FFFF00"><FONT SIZE=-1>A Hillsboro policeman greeted the
witnesses, and was noted as behaving oddly. &quot;He didn't want to give
out any information whatsoever. I talked to a guy who works at Airborne,
and he was monitoring the traffic on their high-band radio, and he said
there were many calls. The cop was very tight lipped, though. The cop told
us at first that it was flight simulating during night practice that they
do once in awhile, and then he left, and came back a few minutes later
and said &quot;we're not sure what it is yet&quot; and he left again, he
didn't really want to give any information out whatsoever.</FONT></FONT></P>

<P><FONT COLOR="#FFFF00"><FONT SIZE=-1>When asked for more specific details
of the falling object, the witness added, &quot;this was a potential fire
hazard, no doubt about it. There was three separate lights, with a red
blinking light in the back. It seemed like it was four separate aircraft,
possibly, but it could have been one. One of the lights did come from the
formation and dropped to the ground, after I noticed it for 30 to 40 seconds.
The other lights kept going toward Rocky Fork Lake after the one dropped.
These lights were visible for about 1 1/2 minutes.&quot;</FONT></FONT></P>

<P><FONT COLOR="#FFFF00"><FONT SIZE=-1>&quot;There were three lights in
a close triangular formation with a blinking light in the rear. They were
moving at average speed across the sky, from west to east at a steady pace.
Then the one on the right side dropped, hit the ground and came back up
straight into the air into the same part of the sky where it came from,
then it started heading north in an arcing motion real quick. We heard
alot about it all night long from people who were calling the department
saying they saw these lights.&quot;</FONT></FONT></P>

<P><B><FONT COLOR="#FFFF00">COMMENT:</FONT></B></P>

<P><FONT COLOR="#FFFF00"><FONT SIZE=-1>The testimony of New Vienna fire
official is a pivotal element which forces a re-evaluation of the flare
theory which had been previously advanced. </FONT></FONT></P>

<P><FONT COLOR="#FFFF00"><FONT SIZE=-1>However, to his observational credit,
The fire and E.M.S. worker did acknowledge that flares were seen being
shot from overflying airplanes. What complicates the matter would be the
testimony of an object hitting the ground and launching back into the air,
only to then make a rapid course change to the north. </FONT></FONT></P>

<P><FONT COLOR="#FFFF00"><FONT SIZE=-1>The A.N.G. Sergeant specified: &quot;These
exercizes are no big problem because the flares don't hit the ground.&quot;</FONT></FONT></P>

<P><FONT COLOR="#FFFF00"><FONT SIZE=-1>However, as noted above, the words
of the A.N.G. Sergeant are obviously in question due to the testimony of
the E.M.S. worker. </FONT></FONT></P>

<P><FONT COLOR="#FFFF00"><FONT SIZE=-1>The first-hand comments from the
E.M.S. worker bolsters some second-hand comments from a resident of Maysville,
Kentucky, who videotaped the flare-like objects from his home. This individual,
interviewed at length by yours truly, is a personal acquaintance with another
witness, who doesn't have a phone, but lives about 5 miles away. This witness
observed 3 flare-like objects that were hovering stationary near his home,
and the objects were sighted in front of a mountain range. Strangely, a
fourth flare-like object 'emerged from the ground' and 'lifted upward'
to hover near the other three, then they all went out at once. The area
the object appeared from was an open field located in PLUMVILLE, Kentucky,
which is five miles east of Maysville. The field was vacant, and the witness
owns the property, and added that nobody could have been there shooting
off fireworks.</FONT></FONT></P>

<P><FONT COLOR="#FFFF00"><FONT SIZE=-1>This unverified account seems to
have been given more weight by the testimony of the E.M.S. worker from
New Vienna, Ohio, even if soft detail that is not firmly established.</FONT></FONT></P>

<P><FONT COLOR="#FFFF00"><FONT SIZE=-1>The comments made by the Mayor's
wife were intruiging, and the nature of the helicopter activity is unclear.
She stated that the helicopters were 'circling' over Route 28. Here are
a few observations regarding this:</FONT></FONT></P>

<UL>
<P><FONT COLOR="#FFFF00"><FONT SIZE=-1>1. Could the helicopters have been
searching for the object which hit the ground? Could they have been looking
for any markings on the ground where the object hit?</FONT></FONT></P>

<P><FONT COLOR="#FFFF00"><FONT SIZE=-1>2. Where did the helicopters originate?
The Sergeant at Springfield A.N.G. advised that all aircraft operating
in the BUCKEYE M.O.A. were catalogued, and furthermore provided a list
of all aircraft used. None were helicopters. Consider also that the helicopters
were present around 2 hours after the sightings.</FONT></FONT></P>

<P><FONT COLOR="#FFFF00"><FONT SIZE=-1>3. It was learned that a CINCINNATI
ENQUIRER reporter contacted WRIGHT- PATTERSON Air Force Base after receiving
phone calls about the aerial disruption. Wright Pat reportedly denied having
any knowledge of the events. Could it be that Wright-Pat, unaware of the
training maneuvers from Springfield, sent out helicopters looking for the
cause of the sightings? Could the helicopters be in the area looking for
UFOs? If so, what agency other than Wright Pat could be responsible for
their operations?</FONT></FONT></P>

<P><FONT COLOR="#FFFF00"><FONT SIZE=-1>4. Would the helicopters have been
used in conjunction with any drones or remote equipment in association
with the earlier flare testing? If so, we have no witnesses who stated
that there were helicopters in the air while the jets were flying overhead.</FONT></FONT></P>

<P><FONT COLOR="#FFFF00"><FONT SIZE=-1>5. The Clinton County Sheriff's
Department advised (telephone conversation with dispatcher, March 27) that
the incident from the previous night had been explainable as 'a couple
of helicopters.' This explanation was perceived... at the time... to be
a ruse by the dispatcher so as not to handle a UFO inquiry. Did they also
have knowledge of the helicopters which were present later that evening,
and did they also associated these helicopters with the activity sited
earlier by so many?</FONT></FONT></P>
</UL>

<P><FONT COLOR="#FFFF00"><FONT SIZE=-1>Although it was previously held
that the MARCH 26th UFO event witnessed by thousands over Southern Ohio
was explainable, we cannot now maintain such a stand without complete review
of witness statements that contradict the attempted explanation. </FONT></FONT></P>

<P><FONT COLOR="#FFFF00"><FONT SIZE=-1>The March 26th event over Southern
Ohio is under serious investigative inquiry, and our findings will be advanced
when sufficient research has been conducted.</FONT></FONT></P>
