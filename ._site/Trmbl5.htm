<P><FONT FACE="ARIAL,HELVETICA"><FONT COLOR="#FFFF00">In the last 20 min
of NBC's Confirmation special, was a segment on a northeast Ohio (in Trumbull
County) police departments' run-in with 3 UFO's. A skeptic stated they
were chasing the planet Mercury. On the below Redshift 3 image of that
night, it is clearly shown Mercury was too close to the sun to have been
seen, and the only planet visible was Saturn. The nearly full moon was
also visible. So now what Mr. Skeptic.</FONT></FONT></P>

<P><I><FONT SIZE=-1>&gt;The true depth of the intellectual dishonesty of
the show's <BR>
&gt;producers is illustrated in their depiction of [the Trumbull <BR>
&gt;County] incident. It's practically a clone of cases 14 and 37<BR>
&gt;from the Colorado project (www.ncas.org/condon/), in which <BR>
&gt;local cops chase things all over the county, and those things <BR>
&gt;turn out to be Venus, Jupiter, Arcturus, and other ordinary <BR>
&gt;astronomical objects.</FONT></I></P>
</UL>

<P>Not to mention many other similar cases, but let's take a fresh look
at this sighting.</P>

<P>As is too common in UFOlogy, good quality evidence concerning the Trumbull
County case is not readily available. Although Kenny Young has had the
911 tape since last June 1, only part of the transcript is available on
the internet and it is _not_ a word-for-word transcription. Audio CDs and
tapes can be purchased, of course, but I will omit that URL. The partial,
non word-for-word &quot;transcript&quot; is at: https://kenny.anomalyresponse.com/Trmbl_transcript.htm</P>

<P>Parts of the tape were played on the Sightings radio show on June 4,
1998 (Trumbull County starts at 1:29 into the show) and on June 17, 1998
(starts at 1:00). The show tapes jump around and coherent progress through
the incident is not easy. Those tapes can be accessed through: https://kenny.anomalyresponse.com/Trumbull_Index.htm</P>

<P>Jim made a pretty serious charge, saying that the producers of the show
were intellectually dishonest about the Trumbull County incident.</P>

<P>Do the police officers say anything on the tape to indicate that they
might be looking at stars or planets? </P>

<UL>
<P>&quot;The light isn't pulsating or anything, it looks like a star or
something up there.&quot; [June 17, 1:29:38; also on transcript]</P>

<P>&quot;I went down to 82 to cross over to North 82 on 11, and the only
thing I see is a white star out there, looks like either Jupiter or Sirius...nothing
moving, nothing pulsating. You might try getting a little more rest during
the day.&quot; [June 17, 1:31:43; also on transcript]</P>

<P>&quot;... I didn't see anything but a white light kind of south- east
of the airport.&quot; [June 17, 1:32:13; also on transcript]</P>

<P>&quot;They're so far away they look like stars.&quot; [June 4, 2:44:55;
not on transcript]</P>

<P>&quot;If it's Venus, well they're six of them. . . little star things.&quot;
[June 17, 1:44:30; not on transcript]</P>

<P>Kenny Young on Sightings: &quot;...Object ascended higher in the sky
[they were looking east]...appeared as a star in the sky...some of the
officers assumed that everyone was seeing stars.&quot; [June 17, 1:41:39]</P>
</UL>

<P>Kenny Young's website also has part of an interview with the officer
who went to the airbase and saw the UFO with the security guard. &quot;The
officer told of how he was pursuing the UFO, which he described as a bright
light with no structure visible.&quot;</P>

<P>What about the officer who saw the three large spaceships with lights
all over them, the ones that were shown on NBC? Here's what he said:</P>

<UL>
<P>&quot;They're sitting stationary. I've got three of them.&quot;</P>

<P>&quot;What do they look like?&quot;</P>

<P>&quot;Well, I'd like to say that they're just like flickering stars
except that I've got four discernible colors: red, yellow, green, and blue.
So if they're those planets those guys were talking about, then they're
planets with Christmas lights on.&quot; [June 4, 2:43:57; not on transcript]</P>

</UL>

<P>So the three spaceships looked like stars? Jim's dishonesty charge is
scoring some serious points against the producers of the show.</P>

<P>How about the thing that kids notice, the old &quot;move-when-I move,
stop-when-I-stop&quot; behavior of astronomical objects? Did any police
officers report that?</P>

<P>In the interview with the officer who went to the airbase, Kenny Young
wrote, &quot;He could never seem to get near to the object, as it always
moved away when he approached.&quot;</P>

<UL>
<P>&quot;This thing's going so fast, there's no way I can keep up with
it. When I pulled in Liberty I could see it in the distance, but I got
closer and it started moving.&quot; [transcript; apparently not on Sightings]</P>

<P>&quot;Looks like I'm getting pretty close here, but I can't really judge
how far out it is now.&quot; [June 4, 2:30:30; part on transcript]</P>
</UL>

<P>Did the officers give any reason why they thought the UFO was not a
planet or star?</P>

<UL>
<P>&quot;This thing has not moved in ten minutes, and it's too bright and
too low and changes colors to be a star.&quot; [June 4, 2:29:40; not on
transcript]</P>
</UL>

<CENTER><P><I>&quot;Starlight can be refracted into a rapid sequence of
colors. <BR>
Red, white, and blue are the most common although every <BR>
color in the spectrum has been reported to me, including <BR>
'gold' and 'lavender.' . . . The effect is especially prominent<BR>
when the stars are near the horizon.&quot; <BR>
Allan Hendry, UFO Handbook, p. 26</I></P></CENTER>

<P>What about the reports of a visible structure to the UFO?</P>

<P>In the transcript and on the tapes, the only officers who said they
could see any structure were using binoculars.</P>

<UL>
<P>&quot;I'm looking at it through binoculars. It's got something protruding
out the top of it.&quot; [June 17, 1:07:11; also on transcript]</P>

<P>&quot;I just pulled off and have it under binocular observation, and
there is definitely a structure there, 429. What you saw ... I can see
an upper structure off the main part of the thing.&quot;</P>

<P>&quot;Yeah, it looks like a little parachute hanging from it.&quot;</P>

<P>&quot;Yeah, something with a different colored lighting to it.&quot;</P>

<P>&quot;Hey, 443, have you been looking at this through binoculars?&quot;</P>

<P>&quot;I've been trying to run as far east to get close and get a clear
visual through my old binoculars and stopped at Brookfield Center, got
a halfway decent look at it, the object you described on top of it.&quot;
[June 17, 1:20:34; also on transcript]</P>
</UL>

<P>Are the officers seeing the UFO clearly, or are they straining to see
something?</P>

<UL>
<P>&quot;I've been watching this thing through binoculars. I can't quite
make it out.&quot; [June 4, 2:29:04; not on transcript]</P>

<P>&quot;A __perfect view__ from where I'm at. I just can't quite make
it out through my binoculars.&quot; [June 4, 2:30:06; not on transcript]</P>
</UL>

<CENTER><P><I>&quot;Whenever witnesses trained magnifying optics on a star
<BR>
undergoing atmospheric distortions, the magnification <BR>
served only to exaggerate the distortion and make the <BR>
situation worse.&quot; <BR>
Allan Hendry, UFO Handbook, p. 31.</I></P></CENTER>

<CENTER><P><I>&quot;Naturally, these witnesses were quick to tell me the
<BR>
shapes of the magnified images plus their sizes, ignoring <BR>
their apparent sizes and shapes to the naked eye. Thus<BR>
I always made a point of asking the witnesses this <BR>
particular question, sometimes to their puzzlement, <BR>
only to learn that the 'saucer' through binoculars was <BR>
only a point source to the eye.&quot; <BR>
Allan Hendry, UFO Handbook, p. 197.</I></P></CENTER>

<P>Were the officers observing through good quality optics?</P>

<UL>
<P>&quot;My binoculars are a cheap set of binoculars.&quot; [Unit 429]
[June 4, 2:33:05; mentioned on transcript]</P>

<P>&quot;I've been trying to ... get a ...clear visual through my old binoculars
and ... got a halfway decent look at it...&quot; [Unit 443, whole sequence
quoted above]</P>
</UL>

<P>So how do Jim's charges hold up when measured against what's said on
the tape?</P>

<UL>
<UL>
<P>1. Many officers mentioned that the UFOs were like stars or planets.
</P>

<P>2. The three UFOs simulated by NBC were specifically described as being
&quot;just like flickering stars.&quot;</P>

<P>3. Officers described apparent movements by the UFO that match a known
illusion when someone looks at a star or planet from a moving vehicle.</P>

<P>4. The only officers who described any structure to the UFO were using
binoculars.</P>

<P>5. The officers were using poor quality binoculars.</P>

<P>6. The officers were not aware that stars and planets can change color
rapidly under the right atmospheric conditions.</P>
</UL>
</UL>

<P>Jim was correct. The show's producers were dishonest about the Trumbull
County UFO.</P>

<P>What about Kenny Young? He did a great investigation of the flares case
in southern Ohio almost two years ago, and UFOlogy's less serious investigators
criticized him severely. This time he totally misinterpreted the event
and his punishment was two appearances on Sightings, a prominent mention
on the NBC show, and tonight he's on Art Bell. That's quality control as
practiced in UFOlogy.</P>

<DIV ALIGN=right><P><I><FONT SIZE=-1>This message appears here with the
permission of Mr. J.K. Cason</FONT></I></P></DIV>

<P><FONT COLOR="#00FFFF"><B><FONT SIZE=+1>Comment in response to above
message:<BR>

</FONT></B><I><FONT SIZE=-1>from Kenny Young</FONT></I></FONT></P>

<P><FONT COLOR="#00FFFF">Would I be correct by thinking that astronomer
James McGaha, who appeared on the NBC special, was equally 'punished?'
Further, Joe Nickell of CSICOP has also made a recent appearance on Art
Bell... is this quality control as practiced in the debunking industry...
or is there a double-standard here?</FONT></P>

<P><FONT COLOR="#00FFFF">In my estimation, Mr. Cason's use of term 'spaceship'
is not an appropriate term to use in the discussion, as it is highly leading
and suggestive. As far as I'm aware, it has not been anywhere argued that
what had been observed by the officers was a &quot;spaceship.&quot; </FONT></P>

<P><FONT COLOR="#00FFFF">The dramatic effects used by CONFIRMATION, although
out of context and used during inappropriate sequences, were essentially
derived from collective eyewitness testimony. The spectacular appearance
of a structured, rotating saucer, however dramatized on television, still
does not suggest that usage of the term &quot;spaceship&quot; would be
appropriate during analysis. </FONT></P>

<P><FONT COLOR="#00FFFF">It is clear that Mr. Cason has taken his time
to selectively pick and choose excerpts from the Trumbull County 9-1-1
tape that <I>-on the surface-</I> readily conforms to the 'twinkling star
scenario.' By doing so and attempting to formulate an argument based upon
selective data (while disregarding contrary material), these methods seem
to constitute a flagrant, one-sided manipulation of detail.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT COLOR="#00FFFF">From the same transcript Mr. Cason is quick to
reference from, here are certain items which he has strangely overlooked:</FONT></P>

<UL>
<P><FONT COLOR="#00FFFF">Male caller #1: What do you know of a strange
object in the sky? It is strange, like the back end of a fighter plane
with flames coming out the back. The object was descending at an angle.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT COLOR="#00FFFF">A female caller phones in to ask for Liberty Police,
reporting a strange airplane or something in the air on Samson Drive. The
caller says it might be a flying saucer, and it is not an airplane. She
says it is down 'awfully low.' This person was asked if she was the same
person who called Ch.33, and she said: &quot;No.&quot; She described the
object as iridescent in color, bluish purple like a long streak with fire
coming out the back of it. Unit #993 to CD, explains that a civilian stopped
him, saying the object appeared to be hovering about 50-feet off the ground.
The civilian said it was a large object with many lights on it, and it
was heading toward the area of Sodom and Hutchins Road. The officer advised
that he would check the area.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT COLOR="#00FFFF">Unit #998: See's some lights about one block over,
large object.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT COLOR="#00FFFF">#996: &quot;What I saw was red like a pulsating
light, like to the bottom of an airplane, but it was real big.&quot; </FONT></P>
</UL>

<P><FONT COLOR="#00FFFF">Furthermore, portions of the tape which have not
been transcribed appear troublesome to dismissive efforts promoted by the
'Star Scenario' proponents. Officers state: &quot;It was NOT a star or
planet,&quot; they discern a clear distinction between stars vs. planets.
</FONT></P>

<P><FONT COLOR="#00FFFF">To add further weight to this, consider a segment
used on CONFIRMATION (where the produers had taken inappropriate 'dramatic
license' that ultimately resulted in distorted detail), which works contrary
to the 'twinkling star scenario,' as the officer indicates a distinction:</FONT></P>

<UL>
<P><FONT COLOR="#00FFFF">&quot;Well, I'd like to say that they're just
like flickering stars except that I've got four discernible colors: red,
yellow, green, and blue. So if they're those planets those guys were talking
about, then they're planets with Christmas lights on.&quot; [June 4, 2:43:57;
not on transcript]</FONT></P>
</UL>

<P><FONT COLOR="#00FFFF">Any contention that the reported 'structure' which
was viewed by the officers was pure misperception based upon two passages
by Allan Hendry in the UFO Handbook, p. 31 and 197, leaves much to be desired.
Why is it that this sort of explanation always tends to violate Occam's
Razor? In this scenario, a half dozen natural phenomena mixed in with witness
misperception is required to explain a single UFO sighting. The odds of
so many things happening at once is astronomical, and we are left thinking
that the explanation is far more unlikely than the report itself.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT COLOR="#00FFFF">I would have to disagree that excitement and misperception
promoted by atmospheric refraction contributed together to create this
event (or more specifically, the entirety of the police pursuit sequence).
Again, <U>consider Occam's Razor</U> (the reason for my disagreement) and
the situation in-context regarding the incident being sparked by the initial
citizen advisement. Something was there... structure later described. </FONT></P>

<P><FONT COLOR="#00FFFF">Occam's Razor basically states that the more simpler
of explanatory ventures is probably the most correct. To obfuscate this
particular case with a dash of this and dash of that (misperception, excitement
and atmospheric refraction) stretches credulity and is far more complicated
than the basic possibility of an aircraft -- identified or otherwise --
operational over this vicinity, observed by citizenry and held under consideration
by law enforcement.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT COLOR="#00FFFF">Most notable was Mr. Cason's lack of attention
to eyewitness testimony gleaned from not only the 9-1-1 recordings but
during eyewitness interviews. Various descriptions are given to recount
the physical appearance of the object, ranging from a bright light to a
structured object with a parachute-like attachment, to an object with an
element protruding from the top of it. The primary object was first said
to have been 'blue-colored' and even described as a 'long streak with flames'
or the &quot;back-end of a fighter jet.&quot; Other callers described a
bluish-green object with flames. Police officers described a brilliant
red light on a 'huge' object, others reported a bright-white light. Still
others described a glowing red, saucer-shaped object which rotated, as
if on an axis. </FONT></P>

<P><FONT COLOR="#00FFFF">The deletion of key detail in conformity with
one particular explanatory venture damages any potential for seriousness
that these dismissive efforts may have been otherwise given.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT COLOR="#00FFFF">I strongly consider the twinkling star scenario
as viable to address some of these sightings, especially during the 'pursuit'
sequence.</FONT></P>

<CENTER><P><U><FONT COLOR="#00FFFF">https://kenny.anomalyresponse.com/Trumbull_Q_and_A.htm</FONT></U></P></CENTER>

<CENTER><P><I><FONT COLOR="#00FFFF">To balance this account, one must also
note the possibility <BR>
that the excited and alert officers could have been observing <BR>
and misidentifying stars or airplanes while on the lookout <BR>
for a UFO reported across the county by several of their <BR>
fellow officers. This is even referenced on the tape as <BR>
speculation by other policemen who apparently did not <BR>
see the main object. However, it should be stressed that <BR>
an officer on the tape did qualify a distinct difference <BR>

between stars and routine air traffic against the unknown <BR>
objects, which he counted to be as many as six. He made<BR>
the analysis while speaking to the controller as he was <BR>
visibly observing the objects. Another officer flatly <BR>
discounted the 'star or planet' scenario, stating that the <BR>
object was 'huge' and lit up the ground as if it were <BR>
daylight.</FONT></I></P></CENTER>

<P><FONT COLOR="#00FFFF">Perhaps researchers inclined to derive selective
information (while disregarding contrary data) with the intent to formulate
an ideological contention could cast aside conjectural pretense and seek
to acquire fact with an objective approach - disregarding agenda in favor
of accuracy.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT COLOR="#00FFFF">It would be most refreshing if these 'agenda-investigators'
would actually pick up their telephones and work a few witnesses for exacting
descriptive detail: at least this would enable more serious consideration
to be given to these legitimate concerns.</FONT></P>
