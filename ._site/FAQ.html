Do police agencies cover up UFO sightings?</a></font></i>						<br>&nbsp;						<p><i><font face="Arial,Helvetica"><a href="#landing">Q. What do I do if a UFO lands in my back yard?</a></font></i></center>						<p><br>						<br>						<br>						<p>						<hr WIDTH="100%">						<br>&nbsp;						<p><a NAME="PHOTO"></a><b><i><font face="Arial,Helvetica">Q. I have rock solid proof of E.T. visitation, man. I have a photograph that will rock the world. How can I collect the cash?</font></i></b>						<p><b><font face="Arial,Helvetica">A. You can't. Well, it's not that simple... not in the real world. And even if you really do have the absolute greatest proof... if you have a sensational UFO videotape or photograph, you will find that the doubters are many and you may not necessarily like what I have to say.</font></b>						<p><b><font face="Arial,Helvetica">First, of course, copy your video/photo and store the original in a safe location.</font></b>						<p><b><font face="Arial,Helvetica">Many folks tend to be proprietary about their UFO videotape or photo, thinking that someday they can pull some money in for having it.&nbsp;</font></b><b><font face="Arial,Helvetica"></font></b>						<p><b><font face="Arial,Helvetica">America is a great place, and if you can make a buck off of something, go for it and more power to you. However, if you have a UFO photo or video, you have no guarantee of stardom and you should hold off on thoughts of celebrity status or big bucks until you are informed about the process.</font></b>						<p><b><font face="Arial,Helvetica">News organizations generally do not pay for footage from the public. For example, I had excellent quality, dramatic videotape of a house fire several years ago that I approached three local TV news stations with. They all wanted the tape but none would agree to pay me anything for the footage. I was told that if there had been a death, the video would have been worth money. So out of frustration, I finally gave the tape to the last station and said 'forget it, take it.' They used the tape and it was their top story and they played the tape over and over.&nbsp;</font></b><b><font face="Arial,Helvetica"></font></b>						<p><b><font face="Arial,Helvetica">Likewise, I have had UFO witnesses complain that news stations would 'hang up on them' or express complete disinterest in viewing their video recordings of a suspected UFO. Even network television programs such as the former TV program SIGHTINGS and others such as REAL TV would play hard ball when it came to giving out money for independent UFO videos. One REAL TV segment that I had planned to be interviewed for broke down during negotiations with the owner of the videotape because they held out for money. The California production company would not deal with any individual requesting money for a UFO video, I was told. So the planned program was canceled.</font></b>						<p><b><font face="Arial,Helvetica">But the story is more complicated than playing hardball with television producers and news stations. The fact is, UFO videos and photos <u>can be faked.</u> That is a sad fact of life and the most paramount concern one should know when thinking of making money from a UFO photo or video.</font></b>						<p><b><font face="Arial,Helvetica">The best thing a person could do would be to have their story, photo or video or other UFO evidence first checked out by a well-grounded, non-agenda UFO researcher who has professional-caliber analysts at their disposal. If you cooperate with the procedure of analysis and verification, that is a good indicator that you trust in the methods of inquiry and have nothing to hide. Most hoaxers do not like to have their material under scrutiny.</font></b>						<p><b><font face="Arial,Helvetica">Once the photos, video or other material is subject to the process of scrutiny and examination by professional analysts, their determination that your photos may be real or 'unexplained' lends that much more credibility to your interests.</font></b>						<p><b><font face="Arial,Helvetica">Throughout this process, proprietary concerns can be worked out and you should select a UFO investigator that you can trust to manage your confidentiality or proprietary interests.</font></b>						<p><b><font face="Arial,Helvetica">If you don't like these steps, then your remaining option would be to put your UFO video on the shelf and let it collect dust, not to share it with the world. What a waste of a good sighting and encounter.</font></b>						<p><b><font face="Arial,Helvetica">But the point in all this is not to expect too much, unless your footage involves a UFO crashing into an airplane or some other mass-calamity witnessed by hundreds, in which case approach a major news organization with a copy of the video and your lawyer by your side.</font></b>						<p><b><font face="Arial,Helvetica">Make the footage available. I agree that if your videotape is used in a larger program, you should receive some compensation.&nbsp;</font></b>						<p><b><font face="Arial,Helvetica">If you have any additional questions or comments about this, or have a photo or videotape may contain a UFO, contact The Anomaly Response Network at						<script type="text/javascript">							/* <![CDATA[ */							function hivelogic_enkoder(){var kode=							"kode=\"oked\\\"=kode\\\"\\\\k=do\\\\e\\\\\\\"k\\\\d=\\\\oe\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\""+							"\\\\\\\\rh\\\\%=,n%gd@?>r_1Al2ppCfvordvjuhoqpsqhA|%d_rrd1_l_ppCfvordvjuhoq"+							"psqh=|wdlrpd%r_oidu_\\\\_@#h?k%dh_l+zwwuh1xqrp%fngg>@rrhhnvgo1ws*l,+u*y1uh"+							"hh,vm+l1+r*\\\\\\\\*q\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\;,\\\"\\\\x='';for(i=0;i<kode.length;"+							"i++){c=kode.charCodeAt(i)-3;if(c<0)c+=128;x+=String.fromCharCode(c)}kode=x"+							";\\\"\\\\\\\\\\\\=x''f;roi(0=i;(<okedl.netg-h)1i;=+)2x{=+okedc.ahAr(t+i)1k"+							"+do.ehcratAi(})okedx=(+<iokedl.netg?hokedc.ahAr(tokedl.netg-h)1':)'\\\"\\"+							"\\x;';;=o'(f=r;i<0kid(.oeeglhn1t;-+)2i{=+)kxd=.oherctaiA1(++o)ekcda.Ah(r)t"+							"kid}=o+eixk(d<.oeeglhnktd?.oherctakAd(.oeeglhn1t:-');'\\\")x;'=;'of(r=i;0<"+							"ik(do.eelgnht1-;)+i2={)+xk=do.ehcratAi(1++)okedc.ahAr(t)ik}do=e+xi(k<do.ee"+							"lgnhtk?do.ehcratAk(do.eelgnht1-:)'';)\";x='';for(i=0;i<(kode.length-1);i+="+							"2){x+=kode.charAt(i+1)+kode.charAt(i)}kode=x+(i<kode.length?kode.charAt(ko"+							"de.length-1):'');"							;var i,c,x;while(eval(kode));}hivelogic_enkoder();							/* ]]> */						</script></font></b>						<br>&nbsp;						<p>						<hr WIDTH="100%">						<p><a NAME="POLICE"></a><b><i><font face="Arial,Helvetica">Q. It is obvious that most police departments do not help UFO researchers and tend to talk in generalities when it comes to UFOs. They also seek to hide sightings by their officers. The truth only surfaces if audio tapes can be obtained. Do they cover up UFO sightings?</font></i></b>						<p><b><font face="Arial,Helvetica">A. This is not my experience. I have dealt with numerous police UFO cases: The Fluor-Daniel Fernald case of 1994, the Waynesville police sightings of 2001, the Oxford/Trenton police case of 2002, the Clermont County UFO video of '94, the Trumbull County UFO Disturbance of '94 and many others.</font></b>						<p><b><font face="Arial,Helvetica">In my experience, most law folks are overworked and underpaid, not partakers of a UFO conspiracy. If it is a genuine case, they will bend over backward to help and will also take interest in it. If they see a UFO hover over the mall and know that you are a researcher and have your address, they will drive to your door, wake you up out of bed to pick you up and take you over there to have a look at it.</font></b>						<p><b><font face="Arial,Helvetica">In cases I've dealt with, badge-wearing witnesses are open and candid about what they've seen. Remarkably objective, as well. However, their testimony - like all testimony - will not be perfect. They, too, are human beings, and sky events and other aerial situations requiring unique observational skills and understanding in a 3D environment do not come as part of their training. Despite their testimony being valid in court, they are still subject to witness misperception and misidentification.</font></b>						<p><b><font face="Arial,Helvetica">Other law officers not so lucky to have had a UFO sighting will remain pleasantly detached and perhaps understandably indifferent toward the subject, or toward an inquiring UFO researcher. They handle inquiries based on training and professionalism. Some may be less-than-receptive to strange or unusual inquiries, especially when their job duties require them to deal with serious emergencies.&nbsp;</font></b>						<p><b><font face="Arial,Helvetica">There could be UFO conspiracies at the local or state police levels. But most conspiracies at this level are "innocent conspiracies." Unwillingness to look or sound like a kook or unwilling to put a co-worker in a similar sort of social jeopardy can be an influential motivator.</font></b>						<p><b><font face="Arial,Helvetica">But if their career is not effected by the situation and there are no societal forces preventing their interest or involvement in UFOs, they usually say "bring 'em on!"</font></b>						<p>						<hr WIDTH="100%">						<p><a NAME="landing"></a><b><i><font face="Arial,Helvetica">Q: What do I do in the event of a UFO sighting or landing?</font></i></b>						<p><b><font face="Arial,Helvetica">If a flaming UFO lands in your back yard... DO NOT call the U.S. Air Force. As crazy as that may sound, it has been the official U.S. Air Force policy to NOT investigate UFO sightings since the closure of Project Blue Book in 1969.&nbsp;</font></b>						<p><b><font face="Arial,Helvetica">If you do call a U.S. Air Force installation with a UFO-related concern, they will actually tell you to call your local police department.&nbsp;</font></b>						<p><b><font face="Arial,Helvetica">In Ohio, the Ohio State Highway Patrol has been given jurisdiction to handle aircraft emergency situations, and they have a "Signal 50" Call Sign referencing the sighting of an unidentified aircraft. Their instructions are to obtain a make and model of the unidentified aircraft in the event of a 'Signal 50 ' situation. If the UFO sighting is confirmed by OSP or other state patrol officers, dispatch headquarters will retain the telephone number to the air tower of the nearest air base, where the information can then be passed along for processing.&nbsp;</font></b><b><font face="Arial,Helvetica"></font></b>						<p><b><font face="Arial,Helvetica">This situation happened in April of 1993 when a UFO was sighted over the Lebanon Correctional Institute as dispatchers at the Warren County Sheriff's Office placed a phone call to a "secret, restricted telephone number" at Wright Patterson Air Force Base in Dayton, Ohio to report the object. Details of this 'restricted phone number' were revealed in a 1995 letter prepared by the Warren County Sheriff's Office.&nbsp;</font></b><b><font face="Arial,Helvetica"></font></b>						<p><b><font face="Arial,Helvetica">We can only presume that official USAF investigations into UFOs would begin at that level, unless we journey into speculation that there would be a super-clandestine command center at some NORAD or U.S. Space Command radar facility that already tracks these objects.</font></b>						<p><b><font face="Arial,Helvetica">Despite USAF policy stating they do not currently investigate sightings, researchers have, over the years, collected a great amount of data that suggests they do. (See book "Beyond UFO Secrecy" by John Greenewald)</font></b>						<p><b><font face="Arial,Helvetica">If a UFO lands in your backyard... DO NOT APPROACH IT. Always remember, safety first. Keep a safe distance from the object and call the police. Get others in the area to witness the event and take photographs and videotape. Take names of other witnesses.</font></b>						<p><b><font face="Arial,Helvetica">Do not attempt to approach or enter the UFO. Please know that UFOs have been reported to undertake hostile action toward people on many occassions. If you are informed about UFOs and historical cases, you will acknowledge that some aspects of the UFO phenomena are not just crop circles and lights in the sky. There are many reports of human injury and death, abductions and mutilations. Consider extreme caution.</font></b>						<p><b><font face="Arial,Helvetica">If you have a UFO sighting, most importantly, call THE CINCINNATI UFO HOTLINE or E-mail
