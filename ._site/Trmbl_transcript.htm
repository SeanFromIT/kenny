<P><FONT COLOR="#FFFF00"><FONT SIZE=-1>This is a partial transcript of
the 9-1-1 Dispatch tapes regarding the December 14, 1994 Trumbull County
UFO incident. It is not a word-for-word transcript. At times, more specific
quotes will appear when deemed important. Special comments will appear
in [brackets].</FONT></FONT> </P>

<P><FONT COLOR="#FFFF00"><FONT SIZE=-1>Many persons are part of this drama.
Their names are not all<BR>
known. Police radio correspondence indicates a UNIT NUMBER to designate
a particular officer on duty. During later portions of the tape when a
more frantic climate arises, it is impossible to determine who is talking.
Unit numbers are not always known, as will be indicated.</FONT></FONT></P>

<P><FONT COLOR="#FFFF00"><FONT SIZE=-1>A prominent person is Central Dispatch
for Liberty Township, Ms. Royanne Rudolph. The time is around or after
midnight. A UFO report has already been received at the Liberty Township
dispatch office, this is not reflected on the present tape (because tapes
changed at midnight), but is referenced. Evidently, the first caller was
a female, and hysterically reporting a low-level object near her home.</FONT></FONT></P>

<HR WIDTH="100%"></P>

<P><B><FONT COLOR="#FFFF00">Begin summation:</FONT></B></P>

<P><FONT COLOR="#FFFF00"><FONT SIZE=-1>County Dispatch (CD): 9-1-1, may
I help you?</FONT></FONT></P>

<P><FONT COLOR="#FFFF00"><FONT SIZE=-1>Male caller #1: What do you know
of a strange object in the sky? It is strange, like the back end of a fighter
plane with flames coming out the back. The object was descending at an
angle.</FONT></FONT></P>

<P><FONT COLOR="#FFFF00"><FONT SIZE=-1>CD then reports to Unit # 996, advising
him of vehicle in the sky near Samson Drive.</FONT></FONT></P>

<P><FONT COLOR="#FFFF00"><FONT SIZE=-1>#996 &amp; #998 ask for description
of object.</FONT></FONT></P>

<P><FONT COLOR="#FFFF00"><FONT SIZE=-1>CD to Bob [perhaps a supervisor]:
4-calls were received regarding a UFO over Liberty. This conversation is
very lively, CD plays back tape of previous call to Bob. CD laughs, Bob
laughs. Bob then advises CD to call the airbase. CD says this will 'start
a frickin' panic.' Bob says 'Mr. Spock' is in town, laughs about being
abducted. CD again asserts that there were 4 or 5 UFO calls.</FONT></FONT></P>

<P><FONT COLOR="#FFFF00"><FONT SIZE=-1>#993 advisess he will be in the
area of Samson Drive. He requests a specific locality where he should go.</FONT></FONT></P>

<P><FONT COLOR="#FFFF00"><FONT SIZE=-1>CD advises #993 of 4 different calls
regarding UFO in the sky. At this point, the time is now 12:30 a.m. as
the dispatcher announces.</FONT></FONT></P>

<P><FONT COLOR="#FFFF00"><FONT SIZE=-1>A phone call is received by CD from
a news reporter from Channel 33 in Youngstown. Her name is Stacey. Channel
33 has received an additional call of a UFO at Samson Drive from a female
caller to the newsroom.</FONT></FONT></P>

<P><FONT COLOR="#FFFF00"><FONT SIZE=-1>CD to Ch.33: &quot;Why are they
in Liberty? There's no intelligent life here!&quot; She laughingly adds
that a Star Trek sequel is being filmed in Liberty. Ch. 33 tells CD that
caller described a bluish-green object with no noise, flying low. The big,
glowing object, which came down and 'zooped over' was now flying up the
Fifth Avenue Extension. CD tells Ch. 33 to do a story on the water in Liberty,
because it is making people crazy. CD laughs, and adds that 'jokers are
on the force tonight' CD tells Ch.33 that they will be given the exclusive
about the UFO, laughingly.</FONT></FONT></P>

<P><FONT COLOR="#FFFF00"><FONT SIZE=-1>A female caller phones in to ask
for Liberty Police, reporting a strange airplane or something in the air
on Samson Drive. The caller says it might be a flying saucer, and it is
not an airplane. She says it is down 'awfully low.' This person was asked
if she was the same person who called Ch.33, and she said: &quot;No.&quot;
She described the object as iridescent in color, bluish purple like a long
streak with fire coming out the back of it.</FONT></FONT></P>

<P><FONT COLOR="#FFFF00"><FONT SIZE=-1>Unit #993 to CD, explains that a
civilian stopped him, saying the object appeared to be hovering about 50-feet
off the ground. The civilian said it was a large object with many lights
on it, and it was heading toward the area of Sodom and Hutchins Road. The
officer advised that he would check the area.</FONT></FONT></P>

<P><FONT COLOR="#FFFF00"><FONT SIZE=-1>CD to #993 Advises that another
report near Samson Drive and call from media referencing the blue-green
object at Fifth Avenue Extension.</FONT></FONT></P>

<P><FONT COLOR="#FFFF00"><FONT SIZE=-1>Unit #998: See's some lights about
one block over, large object.</FONT></FONT></P>

<P><FONT COLOR="#FFFF00"><FONT SIZE=-1>CD requests #996 backup, then #925.
#996 copies, enroute.</FONT></FONT></P>

<P><FONT COLOR="#FFFF00"><FONT SIZE=-1>Unit #998 catches glimpse of UFO
while driving on Samson Road. The object is heading to Fifth Avenue. Lights
seen in area. Officer comments: &quot;Should I set my phaser for stun?&quot;</FONT></FONT></P>

<P><FONT COLOR="#FFFF00"><FONT SIZE=-1>Unit #996 is now on Fifth Avenue
Extension. Advises that the object is &quot;like a red, pulsating light.&quot;</FONT></FONT></P>

<P><FONT COLOR="#FFFF00"><FONT SIZE=-1>CD to units: Object should be blue
and green.</FONT></FONT></P>

<P><FONT COLOR="#FFFF00"><FONT SIZE=-1>#996: &quot;What I saw was red like
a pulsating light, like to the bottom of an airplane, but it was real big.&quot;</FONT></FONT></P>

<P><FONT COLOR="#FFFF00"><FONT SIZE=-1>CD announces: &quot;We will now
contact the airbase at this time, stand by.</FONT></FONT></P>

<P><FONT COLOR="#FFFF00"><FONT SIZE=-1>#996: &quot;Maybe its a flying Christmas
tree.&quot;</FONT></FONT></P>

<P><FONT COLOR="#FFFF00"><FONT SIZE=-1>CD: &quot;Any green men?&quot;</FONT></FONT></P>

<P><FONT COLOR="#FFFF00"><FONT SIZE=-1>CD advises that no more calls had
been received.</FONT></FONT></P>

<P><FONT COLOR="#FFFF00"><FONT SIZE=-1>CD places a phone call to AF Base,
no answer. CD then calls FAA control tower at Youngstown/Warren Municipal
Airport (856-4541). CD advises FAA operator of UFO at Samson Drive and
Fifth Avenue Extension, adds that the object is 'in our jurisdiction,'
and that call is not a prank.</FONT></FONT></P>

<P><FONT COLOR="#FFFF00"><FONT SIZE=-1>FAA: &quot;I am looking at the radarscope,
60-mile diameter of Youngstown and there is 'nothing' out there.</FONT></FONT></P>

<P><FONT COLOR="#FFFF00"><FONT SIZE=-1>CD: &quot;Oh shit.&quot;</FONT></FONT></P>

<P><FONT COLOR="#FFFF00"><FONT SIZE=-1>FAA: &quot;Not even anything up
high, no airplanes.&quot;</FONT></FONT></P>

<P><FONT COLOR="#FFFF00"><FONT SIZE=-1>CD advises of 5 calls, asks if FAA
would be able to monitor a Cessna airplane w/headlight on radar.</FONT></FONT></P>

<P><FONT COLOR="#FFFF00"><FONT SIZE=-1>FAA replies: &quot;Depends on how
high &amp; low. If low, radar coverage isn't any good.&quot;</FONT></FONT></P>

<P><FONT COLOR="#FFFF00"><FONT SIZE=-1>CD explains that she doesn't want
to tell units that FAA has no track of UFO on radar. She asks if FAA has
a 'clause' used to dismiss sightings.</FONT></FONT></P>

<P><FONT COLOR="#FFFF00"><FONT SIZE=-1>FAA: &quot;Could be, could be. Maybe
it was a helicopter or something like that, flying low. Are you close to
a hospital?&quot;</FONT></FONT></P>

<P><FONT COLOR="#FFFF00"><FONT SIZE=-1>CD: &quot;As low as they said it
was from the ground, it would be approximately 5-miles from the hospital.&quot;
CD indicates that the area in question is closer to the Vienna Township
line, near the Vienna Airbase area.</FONT></FONT></P>

<P><FONT COLOR="#FFFF00"><FONT SIZE=-1>FAA: &quot;We haven't had anything
going on. About a half-hour ago a [took off] out here northbound and climbed
up high, but there's nothing now in that direction.&quot;</FONT></FONT></P>

<P><FONT COLOR="#FFFF00"><FONT SIZE=-1>CD: I'm advising you of this, file
it in the &quot;G-for garbage&quot; can if you want to.</FONT></FONT></P>

<P><FONT COLOR="#FFFF00"><FONT SIZE=-1>CD puts FAA on hold, comes back
to say 4 to 6 calls have now come in regarding a UFO above Samson Drive
and Fifth Avenue. The object is low to the ground with no noise, and hovered
for some time prior to departure down Fifth Avenue Extension. Advises that
a unit also observed a red object.</FONT></FONT></P>

<P><FONT COLOR="#FFFF00"><FONT SIZE=-1>FAA: &quot;I can refer you to an
800-number for UFO reports during business hours.&quot;</FONT></FONT></P>

<P><FONT COLOR="#FFFF00"><FONT SIZE=-1>CD: &quot;No.&quot;</FONT></FONT></P>

<P><FONT COLOR="#FFFF00"><FONT SIZE=-1>FAA: &quot;I don't see anything
out there, nothing on radarscope and we don't really do anything with the
information.&quot;</FONT></FONT></P>

<P><FONT COLOR="#FFFF00"><FONT SIZE=-1>CD: &quot;Well, I thought I'd pass
it on to you in case just so I'd do my job.&quot;</FONT></FONT></P>

<P><FONT COLOR="#FFFF00"><FONT SIZE=-1>More Central Dispatch-to-Unit correspondence
at this point</FONT></FONT></P>

<P><FONT COLOR="#FFFF00"><FONT SIZE=-1>Unit #998: In clear now, doesn't
see object anymore, but has no idea what he saw. Says: &quot;Might have
been a light in the sky.&quot;</FONT></FONT></P>

<P><FONT COLOR="#FFFF00"><FONT SIZE=-1>Unit #925: Surrounding jurisdictions
advised to stop and interrogate &quot;if they come across that.&quot;</FONT></FONT></P>

<P><FONT COLOR="#FFFF00"><FONT SIZE=-1>Female caller to CD, asking about
UFO. CD says dispatcher presently on phone with airbase at this time. Liberty
thinks it is from the airbase.</FONT></FONT></P>

<P><FONT COLOR="#FFFF00"><FONT SIZE=-1>CD to Units: We've contacted FAA,
they have nothing nor communication with private vehicles or helicopters.</FONT></FONT></P>

<P><FONT COLOR="#FFFF00"><FONT SIZE=-1>Unit #998: Then they're not aware
of anything?</FONT></FONT></P>

<P><FONT COLOR="#FFFF00"><FONT SIZE=-1>CD: Negative. They have nothing
nor communication with private vehicles or helicopters.</FONT></FONT></P>

<P><FONT COLOR="#FFFF00"><FONT SIZE=-1>Unit #998: OK.</FONT></FONT></P>

<P><FONT COLOR="#FFFF00"><FONT SIZE=-1>CD: We are continually getting calls
on this also. The last call was two minutes ago.</FONT></FONT></P>

<P><FONT COLOR="#FFFF00"><FONT SIZE=-1>Unit #998: What's the area?</FONT></FONT></P>

<P><FONT COLOR="#FFFF00"><FONT SIZE=-1>CD: Still Samson &amp; Fifth.</FONT></FONT></P>

<P><FONT COLOR="#FFFF00"><FONT SIZE=-1>UNKNOWN UNIT #1: We're right there,
there's nothing there now.</FONT></FONT></P>

<P><FONT COLOR="#FFFF00"><FONT SIZE=-1>UNKNOWN UNIT #2: [jokingly] It's
only visible to certain people.</FONT></FONT></P>

<P><FONT COLOR="#FFFF00"><FONT SIZE=-1>Unit #998 to CD: If you get any
more calls, I'd like an address. I'd like to speak to people making the
calls.</FONT></FONT></P>

<P><FONT COLOR="#FFFF00"><FONT SIZE=-1>CD: Copy.</FONT></FONT></P>

<P><FONT COLOR="#FFFF00"><FONT SIZE=-1>Unit #998: I will be out of service
a couple of minutes, I have to gather my thoughts.</FONT></FONT></P>

<P><FONT COLOR="#FFFF00"><FONT SIZE=-1>CD: Copy gathering, 12:58 [time
marker].</FONT></FONT></P>

<P><FONT COLOR="#FFFF00"><FONT SIZE=-1>Unit #998: I'm ok now, I'm back
in service.</FONT></FONT></P>

<P><FONT COLOR="#FFFF00"><FONT SIZE=-1>CD: Back in service, 12:59 [time
marker]</FONT></FONT></P>

<P><FONT COLOR="#FFFF00"><FONT SIZE=-1>This segment is a phone discussion
between CD and Unit #998 about the object. Unit #998 shaken, describes
big red glow 'bright as daylight on the ground.' Explains encounter with
civilian on the road. Describes red object, noiseless, at treetop level.</FONT></FONT></P>

<P><FONT COLOR="#FFFF00"><FONT SIZE=-1>Unit #429 advises CD that UFO is
east of her location. She leaves post to go look. #429 says that he has
been watching the object for 10 minutes with binoculars, and the object
has not moved. Unit #429 says that there was a UFO sighting two weeks earlier,
as well.</FONT></FONT></P>

<P><FONT COLOR="#FFFF00"><FONT SIZE=-1>UNKNOWN UNIT A: We have a pretty
good view out here near Kings Grave. UNKNOWN UNIT B: Looks like I'm getting
pretty close here. UNIT #429: That bugger has not moved. UNKNOWN UNIT B:
I'm going over to Leven [Road?] right now and starting to maybe get next
to it here... UNIT #429: It's just above the trees, yeah! UNKNOWN UNIT:
The airbase should know what this is. UNIT #429: Mikey's up here now, he's
looking through the binocs, it looks like it might've moved. It moved from
one side of the tree to another. UNKNOWN FEMALE VOICE: It's over around
Leven. UNKNOWN UNIT: Ridge already, Ridge at the airbase. UNKNOWN UNIT:
It's doing circles.</FONT></FONT></P>

<P><FONT COLOR="#FFFF00"><FONT SIZE=-1>Two units attempt to triangulate
the position of the UFO from two different locations. #429 announces that
he is 1/2 mile south of Kings Grave on Henheid, and the object is south
of his location. CD Royanne returns, out of breathe, said she did not see
object. Unit #429 announces that he is still on Henheid north of Caine
[sp?], and near a house that is under construction. They are watching it
over an empty field. The color of the UFO changes from whitish red to pulsating
greenish lavender. #429 complains about a cheap set of binoculars.</FONT></FONT></P>

<P><FONT COLOR="#FFFF00"><FONT SIZE=-1>CD: I'm calling the air base again.</FONT></FONT></P>

<P><FONT COLOR="#FFFF00"><FONT SIZE=-1>Unit #429 announces that he is coming
to the dispatch office to pick up dispatcher Royanne to take her to see
the object. She states that she will be taking a break to see it. Before
taking the break, she places another call to the FAA tower.</FONT></FONT></P>

<P><FONT COLOR="#FFFF00"><FONT SIZE=-1>CD to FAA [frantic]: The darn thing
is in Howland Township now, hovering over Henheid, about five minutes from
the center. Do you show anything on your radar screen over the Warren area?
They're seeing it, 50-feet from the ground with a red holding light. There
are blue and green lights, no noise. We've had this all night.</FONT></FONT></P>

<P><FONT COLOR="#FFFF00"><FONT SIZE=-1>FAA: I'm looking to the west, and
I don't see anything. I'm 70-feet in the air.</FONT></FONT></P>

<P><FONT COLOR="#FFFF00"><FONT SIZE=-1>CD then gives the phone number of
the Liberty Twp. dispatch office to the FAA operator to contact, and advises
him that she is now going to go see the object.</FONT></FONT></P>

<P><FONT COLOR="#FFFF00"><FONT SIZE=-1>TAPE BREAK</FONT></FONT></P>

<P><FONT COLOR="#FFFF00"><FONT SIZE=-1>Telephone conversation, 2 officers,
one of them a controller at an unspecified department in Trumbull County
Person #1: The FAA didn't see it Person #2: That is a joke, that is a joke.
Person #1: We got 8 calls about it. Person #2: Liberty was telling us about
it. Person #1: We got calls on it last night, too. Person #2: How's a UFO
going to be detected on radar if it's Stealth? Person #1: We got 8-calls
earlier. Person #2: It's hard to say. In winter months, you see alot more
shooting stars because the sky is clear. Person #1: With the cold, they
drag on. Person #2: I saw one good one tonight that was bright. Pete was
joking about that. Person #1: Beam me up, scotty [laughs] Person #2: That's
probably what they're seeing. Person #1: We'll make a note of it.</FONT></FONT></P>

<P><FONT COLOR="#FFFF00"><FONT SIZE=-1>A gentleman at 'the jail' calls
the dispatch office on the telephone to ask about the UFO situation. The
controller explains that the UFO is presently being seen, and says that
UFO reports were also received the previous evening. The controller explains
that a Howland police officer is also a witness to the present UFO as well.</FONT></FONT></P>

<P><FONT COLOR="#FFFF00"><FONT SIZE=-1>TAPE BREAK:</FONT></FONT></P>

<P><FONT COLOR="#FFFF00"><FONT SIZE=-1>A new, unidentified controller is
now speaking with Unit #433.</FONT></FONT></P>

<P><FONT COLOR="#FFFF00"><FONT SIZE=-1>Controller: Did the UFO move? Unit
#433: Negative, but I'm out at the air base here, standing here watching
it. It looks like he's just sitting here.</FONT></FONT></P>

<P><FONT COLOR="#FFFF00"><FONT SIZE=-1>A male respondant advises Unit #433
that a subject is enroute</FONT></FONT></P>

<P><FONT COLOR="#FFFF00"><FONT SIZE=-1>[Special note: The sequence which
is to follow contains the POLICE PURSUIT of the UFO, and the rapid-fire
action and radio traffic cannot be easily charted. Dialogue will be listed
below, frequently without attribution, as it is not known what 'Unit' is
speaking.]</FONT></FONT></P>

<P><FONT COLOR="#FFFF00"><FONT SIZE=-1>Unknown Unit: I've got a visual
on it! I'm east on Old [Rt.] 82 with a visual on it by the 'S' curve! I
can see a large red, blue and green light. I am going east on Liberty.
This thing's going so fast, there's no way I can keep up with it. When
I pulled in Liberty I could see it in the distance, but I got closer and
it started moving.</FONT></FONT></P>

<P><FONT COLOR="#FFFF00"><FONT SIZE=-1>Unknown voice: Which Liberty?</FONT></FONT></P>

<P><FONT COLOR="#FFFF00"><FONT SIZE=-1>Unknown Unit: Liberty off of Belmont.
I don't see it now, I'm on Logan now.</FONT></FONT></P>

<P><FONT COLOR="#FFFF00"><FONT SIZE=-1>Voice: OK, 429, its south of Old
82, I'm moving east on it!</FONT></FONT></P>

<P><FONT COLOR="#FFFF00"><FONT SIZE=-1>Unit #429: I'm still stationary
at the airbase. Its pulsating.</FONT></FONT></P>

<P><FONT COLOR="#FFFF00"><FONT SIZE=-1>Voice: Affirmative, I'm looking
at it through binoculars. Its got something protruding out the top of it.</FONT></FONT></P>

<P><FONT COLOR="#FFFF00"><FONT SIZE=-1>Voice: I'm on Belmont now.</FONT></FONT></P>

<P><FONT COLOR="#FFFF00"><FONT SIZE=-1>Voice: It's over [Railroad?] tracks
now...</FONT></FONT></P>

<P><FONT COLOR="#FFFF00"><FONT SIZE=-1>Voice: It's hovering now!</FONT></FONT></P>

<P><FONT COLOR="#FFFF00"><FONT SIZE=-1>Voice: I see it now, too!</FONT></FONT></P>

<P><FONT COLOR="#FFFF00"><FONT SIZE=-1>Voice: It looks like its flickering
more now and its east of me now! I'm heading east on Old 82...</FONT></FONT></P>

<P><FONT COLOR="#FFFF00"><FONT SIZE=-1>Voice: I've got a pretty good view
from here!</FONT></FONT></P>

<P><FONT COLOR="#FFFF00"><FONT SIZE=-1>Voice: I'm dead east on it, it's
slightly north of us!</FONT></FONT></P>

<P><FONT COLOR="#FFFF00"><FONT SIZE=-1>Two other officers corresond separately</FONT></FONT></P>

<P><FONT COLOR="#FFFF00"><FONT SIZE=-1>Officer A: I heard that Liberty
had some traffic regard to that, too...</FONT></FONT></P>

<P><FONT COLOR="#FFFF00"><FONT SIZE=-1>Officer B: Voice: We know they definetely
saw something, because we're seeing it.</FONT></FONT></P>

<P><FONT COLOR="#FFFF00"><FONT SIZE=-1>Voice: It's extremely bright, really
bright.</FONT></FONT></P>

<P><FONT COLOR="#FFFF00"><FONT SIZE=-1>Voice: It's all the way into Liberty
now, into Hubbard now...</FONT></FONT></P>

<P><FONT COLOR="#FFFF00"><FONT SIZE=-1>Unit #998 to RADIO: Is Howland reporting
sightings?</FONT></FONT></P>

<P><FONT COLOR="#FFFF00"><FONT SIZE=-1>RADIO: That is affirmative.</FONT></FONT></P>

<P><FONT COLOR="#FFFF00"><FONT SIZE=-1>Voice: Hey Walter, chase it back
north, I want to see this thing.</FONT></FONT></P>

<P><FONT COLOR="#FFFF00"><FONT SIZE=-1>WALTER: From Howland and how far
it's visible you should be able to see it...</FONT></FONT></P>

<P><FONT COLOR="#FFFF00"><FONT SIZE=-1>Voice: I'm going to head out to
[Route?] 305 and get a glimpse of it from there.</FONT></FONT></P>

<P><FONT COLOR="#FFFF00"><FONT SIZE=-1>UNIT #2223: I've got a visual on
both of them, I'm sure you know what I'm talking about.</FONT></FONT></P>

<P><FONT COLOR="#FFFF00"><FONT SIZE=-1>CONTROL: 10-4. We have multiple
departments right now that has sightings on it.</FONT></FONT></P>

<P><FONT COLOR="#FFFF00"><FONT SIZE=-1>UNIT #2223: OK, I've got them both.
I've got Howland saying it looks like its in the area of Warren Road, Liberty
says its down near Hubbard.</FONT></FONT></P>

<P><FONT COLOR="#FFFF00"><FONT SIZE=-1>CONTROL: If you see anything close
and can identify it, let us know.</FONT></FONT></P>

<P><FONT COLOR="#FFFF00"><FONT SIZE=-1>UNIT #2223: Affirmative.</FONT></FONT></P>

<P><FONT COLOR="#FFFF00"><FONT SIZE=-1>TAPE BREAK</FONT></FONT></P>

<P><FONT COLOR="#FFFF00"><FONT SIZE=-1>OFFICER X: I'm past 84-Lumber [hardware
store] still eastbound, its southeast of my location.</FONT></FONT></P>

<P><FONT COLOR="#FFFF00"><FONT SIZE=-1>UNKNOWN UNIT: It doesn't seem like
it moved at all from where I'm at.</FONT></FONT></P>

<P><FONT COLOR="#FFFF00"><FONT SIZE=-1>VOICE: OK, are you by yourself,
or is there someone documenting the observation also?</FONT></FONT></P>

<P><FONT COLOR="#FFFF00"><FONT SIZE=-1>UNKNOWN UNIT: I'm at the airbase,
I've got the security guard out here, he doesn't know what to make of it,
either. We can see it from right here.</FONT></FONT></P>

<P><FONT COLOR="#FFFF00"><FONT SIZE=-1>VOICE #2: Did you ask Liberty Dispatch
the outcome of the FAA inquiry?</FONT></FONT></P>

<P><FONT COLOR="#FFFF00"><FONT SIZE=-1>UNIT #433: Last check, radar at
the airport was advising nothing on their screens. They wouldn't tell us
anyway if its anything to do with the military. We've had another 'Hangar
7' happen in Trumbull County.</FONT></FONT></P>

<P><FONT COLOR="#FFFF00"><FONT SIZE=-1>UNKNOWN FEMALE CONTROLLER: It's
in Brookfield, now.</FONT></FONT></P>

<P><FONT COLOR="#FFFF00"><FONT SIZE=-1>UNIT #998: We can see it from Route
62, a large light with red in it!</FONT></FONT></P>

<P><FONT COLOR="#FFFF00"><FONT SIZE=-1>UNIT #223: I'm going to go up in
the tower!</FONT></FONT></P>

<P><FONT COLOR="#FFFF00"><FONT SIZE=-1>UNIT #443: Did you hear from Liberty
or Youngstown?</FONT></FONT></P>

<P><FONT COLOR="#FFFF00"><FONT SIZE=-1>Male Controller: Everyone in the
county has a visual on it that I can hear.</FONT></FONT></P>

<P><FONT COLOR="#FFFF00"><FONT SIZE=-1>2nd Voice: Right now, control is
copying that it is somewhere in Brookfield Township, east of 84-Lumber
on Warren/Sharon Road. We've got a unit at the old county home on Route
7 with a visual at this time. Looks like its going southeast.</FONT></FONT></P>

<P><FONT COLOR="#FFFF00"><FONT SIZE=-1>Officer C: I'm almost to Brookfield,
I just pulled off and have it under binocular observation, and there is
definitely a structure there, 429. What you saw... I can see an upper structure
off the main part of the lighting.</FONT></FONT></P>

<P><FONT COLOR="#FFFF00"><FONT SIZE=-1>UNIT #429: Yeah, it almost looks
like a little parachute hanging from it.</FONT></FONT></P>

<P><FONT COLOR="#FFFF00"><FONT SIZE=-1>Officer C: Yeah, something with
a different colored lighting to it.</FONT></FONT></P>

<P><FONT COLOR="#FFFF00"><FONT SIZE=-1>UNIT #429: Hey, 443, have you been
looking at this through binoculars?</FONT></FONT></P>

<P><FONT COLOR="#FFFF00"><FONT SIZE=-1>UNIT #443: I've been trying to run
as far east to get as close and get a clear visual through my old binoculars
and stopped at Brookfield Center, got a halfway decent look at it, the
object you described on top of it.</FONT></FONT></P>

<P><FONT COLOR="#FFFF00"><FONT SIZE=-1>UNIT 2223: What unit is that?</FONT></FONT></P>

<P><FONT COLOR="#FFFF00"><FONT SIZE=-1>Voice: UFO's near Courtland!</FONT></FONT></P>

<P><FONT COLOR="#FFFF00"><FONT SIZE=-1>2nd Voice: Is anybody close to that
thing?</FONT></FONT></P>

<P><FONT COLOR="#FFFF00"><FONT SIZE=-1>Male voice: Last seen it was southeast
from 84-Lumber, in that area.</FONT></FONT></P>

<P><FONT COLOR="#FFFF00"><FONT SIZE=-1>Voice: If you come up on [Rt] 46,
you should be able to see it without any problems. I could pick it up on
North Hill Road.</FONT></FONT></P>

<P><FONT COLOR="#FFFF00"><FONT SIZE=-1>3rd Voice: I'm at [Rt] 305 &amp;
sitting on the overpass and I don't see anything.</FONT></FONT></P>

<P><FONT COLOR="#FFFF00"><FONT SIZE=-1>OFFICER: I'm at Fowler &amp; Ridge,
how high up are we talking here, above the horizon?</FONT></FONT></P>

<P><FONT COLOR="#FFFF00"><FONT SIZE=-1>Voice: Not very far. If you're in
the treeline it'll block your view.</FONT></FONT></P>

<P><FONT COLOR="#FFFF00"><FONT SIZE=-1>2nd Voice: Will I be able to see
it if I go south on [Rt] 11?</FONT></FONT></P>

<P><FONT COLOR="#FFFF00"><FONT SIZE=-1>OFFICER: Yeah, you should, just
look out toward Kings Grave, toward the airbase.</FONT></FONT></P>

<P><FONT COLOR="#FFFF00"><FONT SIZE=-1>Voice: Allright, I'll take a shot
down [Rt] 11.</FONT></FONT></P>

<P><FONT COLOR="#FFFF00"><FONT SIZE=-1>UNIT 2223: I'm clear from the homes,
I'm going to go closer to it.</FONT></FONT></P>

<P><FONT COLOR="#FFFF00"><FONT SIZE=-1>CONTROL: What was your last location
you saw it, where is it at now?</FONT></FONT></P>

<P><FONT COLOR="#FFFF00"><FONT SIZE=-1>UNIT 2223: It looks like its right
around 84 Lumber. I will head down [Rt] 82 and will advise.</FONT></FONT></P>

<P><FONT COLOR="#FFFF00"><FONT SIZE=-1>CONTROL: 10-4, give me a registration
when you can.</FONT></FONT></P>

<P><FONT COLOR="#FFFF00"><FONT SIZE=-1>UNIT #998: I don't know what this
is... it's a large light in the sky, changing colors. We tried to signal
it... [tape break, then resumes] It's in Brookfield now, pretty far from
us.</FONT></FONT></P>

<P><FONT COLOR="#FFFF00"><FONT SIZE=-1>FEMALE CONTROLLER: 10-4</FONT></FONT></P>

<P><FONT COLOR="#FFFF00"><FONT SIZE=-1>Unidentified voice: We got this
white light over the top of the airbase.</FONT></FONT></P>

<P><FONT COLOR="#FFFF00"><FONT SIZE=-1>OFFICER: Yeah, that's probably it.</FONT></FONT></P>

<P><FONT COLOR="#FFFF00"><FONT SIZE=-1>Unidentified voice: The light isn't
pulsating or anything, it looks like a star or something up there.</FONT></FONT></P>

<P><FONT COLOR="#FFFF00"><FONT SIZE=-1>OFFICER: How far are you from the
airbase?</FONT></FONT></P>

<P><FONT COLOR="#FFFF00"><FONT SIZE=-1>Unidentified voice: I'm near the
airbase on [Rt] 11, but it's southeast of there, looks to be rather high,
though, not just over the treeline.</FONT></FONT></P>

<P><FONT COLOR="#FFFF00"><FONT SIZE=-1>OFFICER: It's not much farther.</FONT></FONT></P>

<P><FONT COLOR="#FFFF00"><FONT SIZE=-1>Voice: Have you heard from Wally
or did he get beamed up?</FONT></FONT></P>

<P><FONT COLOR="#FFFF00"><FONT SIZE=-1>Controller repeatedly attempts to
contact Howland Unit #433 for status and receives no answer. Finally, #433
comes on and announces that he can't &quot;get down in and was coming back.&quot;</FONT></FONT></P>

<P><FONT COLOR="#FFFF00"><FONT SIZE=-1>Unknown Officer: I went down to
[Rt] 82 to cross over North 82 on [Rt] 11, and the only thing I see is
a white star out there, looks like either Jupiter or Sirius... nothing
moving, nothing pulsating. You might try getting a little more rest during
the day...</FONT></FONT></P>

<P><FONT COLOR="#FFFF00"><FONT SIZE=-1>Officer then makes a joke about
his decade of third shift duty and of shift rotation.</FONT></FONT></P>

<P><FONT COLOR="#FFFF00"><FONT SIZE=-1>Unknown Officer:Unless I'm looking
at the wrong thing, Walt, I didn't see anything but a white light southeast
of the airport.</FONT></FONT></P>

<P><FONT COLOR="#FFFF00"><FONT SIZE=-1>Voice: Keep trying, Walt. You'll

find something.</FONT></FONT></P>

<P><FONT COLOR="#FFFF00"><FONT SIZE=-1>TAPE BREAK: This next segment is
a cellular telephone discussion recorded on the 9-1-1 channel because of
the open phone line to the dispatch office. The conversation is between
Controller Hutch and Officer Baker</FONT></FONT></P>

<P><FONT COLOR="#FFFF00"><FONT SIZE=-1>BAKER: [jokes] I talked to these
guys, everythings allright, they're going to go back to where they came
from.</FONT></FONT></P>

<P><FONT COLOR="#FFFF00"><FONT SIZE=-1>HUTCH: Did you see anything?</FONT></FONT></P>

<P><FONT COLOR="#FFFF00"><FONT SIZE=-1>BAKER: I can see them. I've got
them right here. I'm looking at it.</FONT></FONT></P>

<P><FONT COLOR="#FFFF00"><FONT SIZE=-1>HUTCH: What the hell is it?</FONT></FONT></P>

<P><FONT COLOR="#FFFF00"><FONT SIZE=-1>BAKER: I can see it from Warren
Road.</FONT></FONT></P>
