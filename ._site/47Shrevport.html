<p><font face="Lucida Console">The population of Shreveport, La., had its
share of disc excitement when a resident reported seeing a "saucer" whirl
through the air, shooting smoke and fire, and come to rest on a downtown
thoroughfare.&nbsp; A police investigation, however, revealed that the
"saucer" was the work of a prankster who launched the homemade disc from
the top of a downtown office building as a joke on his boss.&nbsp;&nbsp;
This "Saucer" employed a starter from a fluorescent light and two electric
fan condensers.</font>
<br><font face="Lucida Console">&nbsp;</font>
<br><font face="Lucida Console">A flying disc became big business in Black
River Falls, Wisc., where the finder charged 50 cents admission for a look
at the "saucer" until local police stepped in and shut it up in a bank
vault.&nbsp;&nbsp; The contrivance, which was fashioned from plywood and
cardboard was supposedly seen in flight near Black River Falls shortly
before an electrician said he found</font>
<br><font face="Lucida Console">it lying in deep grass on the town fairgrounds.
After analysis at Mitchell Field, the following report was made:</font><font face="Lucida Console"></font>
<p><font face="Lucida Console">"This contrivance is patently a hoax...it
will be held for a reasonable length of time and then disposed of in the
nearest ash</font>
<br><font face="Lucida Console">receptacle."</font><font face="Lucida Console"></font>
