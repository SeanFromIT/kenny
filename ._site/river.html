An independent investigation ofthat claim by Yours Truly revealed that a security guard at one of theplants along the river near Maysville, Kentucky had logged the sightingof an unusual aircraft in his logbook at the same date and time. Despitethis strong authentication of the sighting report, local Maysville, Kentuckynews media would not assist in further exploration of this subject.</b><b></b><p><b>In the following months, a number of other similar reports beganto surface from the Ohio River city of Portsmouth. A Portsmouth residentinformed that he would spy an unusual object in the late night hours, oftencoming down in the vicinity of the bridges. He would usually retreat toa high position on top of a Portsmouth church building to view the episode.In response to this and several other reports from this individual, a "UFOWatch" was undertaken in the summer of 2002 with the Portsmouth residentand another participant from West Portsmouth, Ohio, plus Yours Truly.</b><b></b><p><b>Lexington, Kentucky resident Earle Benezet of Kentucky MUFON advisedthat several fisherman from Covington, Kentucky have also alerted him toUFO activity along the Ohio River near New Richmond, Ohio. The witness,reportedly along with other numerous fishermen, Benezet said, have reportedcertain and large triangular objects, one said to be 'a football field'in length. He advised that one reported object obstructed starglow. Onefisherman offered to accompany Benezet to the location but that activityis pending as Benezet has yet been able to obtain some kind of follow upto the reports.</b><b></b><p><b>And as of May 1, 2003, another report of a UFO spying the southernOhio River area between Cincinnati and Huntington, WVA has crept up, thisreport originating from Ashland, Kentucky, as reported to the NationalUFO Center in Seattle, Washington. That report is enclosed below.</b><b></b><p><b>There is a similarity in the reported objects recently seen alongthe Ohio River, many described as illuminated triangular objects the sizeof a small car. What is going on along the Ohio River between Cincinnatiand Ashland, Kentucky? Has this area become a new UFO hotspot?</b><b></b><p><b>If you have any information or video that might assist with thisinvestigation, please call 513-588-4548.</b><p><hr WIDTH="100%"><b><u></u></b><p><b><u>FROM NATIONAL UFO REPORTING CENTER</u></b><p>Sighting Report<br>Occurred : 5/1/2003 15:00 (Entered as : 5/01/03 15:00)<br>Reported: 5/3/2003 9:23:42 AM 09:23<br>Posted: 5/9/2003<br>Location: Ashland, KY<br>Shape: Changing<br>Duration:10 minutes<br>Mid-afternoon sighting over Ohio River<p>#1.

Number of Witnesses - who else may have also had this experience?Anyone in town who had a sightline, cars crossing the bridge, etc.<p>#8. Details - provide all the minor/major details I was looking outthe window of my 5th floor room in the Ashland Plaza hotel at a developinglightning storm to the right. My room faced the river. I am not sure ofthe orientation but that would be easy enough to determine from a map ofthe area.<p>I noticed an object about the size of a small car floating in the airover the river, I'm not sure of the altitude, but it was a little lessthan twice as high as the bridge, at least from my perspective. It wasmoving to the left, in the direction of the wind, as I could tell fromthe flag in front of the courthouse across the street. Although the windwas stiff, the object moved slowly in a controlled and deliberate manner,without the vagrant, flapping, unstable motion of, say, a plastic bag.Apparently, it made no sound. However, this hotel has windows that can'tbe opened, so that may not be verifiable.<p>It was black and roughly triangular in shape. It was either changingshape in motion or rolling somehow. I thought it was a kite or a paraglidersomeone was flying off the back of a boat, as it was following the courseof the river. That theory was shattered when it continued over the bridge.Shortly afterwards, it deviated away from the river, and me, and dwindledaway to an invisible speck in the distance.<p>I'm not claiming this was an aircraft or anything else, BTW. It wasan UFO at least as far as I'm concerned, if only for the simple fact thatI couldn't identify it. Perhaps there were other witnesses or an explanationof some kind. If so, I'd like to know.</body></html>
