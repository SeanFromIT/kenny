<center><font size=+3>The Monsanto Research Complex</font>
<br><font size=+2>and The 'Seeding' of America</font>
<p><font size=-1>by Kenny Young</font></center>

<p>With the July, 1997 publication of PHILLIP J. CORSO'S "Day After Roswell",
the retired Lieutenant Colonel who served under Eisenhower introduced the
public to the concept of the 'seeding' of American industry and corporations
with exotic technology derived from recovered extraterrestrial vehicles.
<p>In the midst of the hype and furor over the Corso publication, I couldn't
help but temper my disbelief in serious consideration of his claims, because
of a bizarre encounter that I have been absorbed in for nearly two years.
<p><i><tt><font size=+2>Mystery Tattler</font></tt></i>
<p>In the spring of 1995 I received a phone call from a resident of Springfield,
Ohio. "I wanted to tell you about certain reverse- engineering projects
conducted on flying saucer components," stated the voice on the other end
of the phone line. The caller had tracked me down after a statewide Associated
Press newspaper article was published in a Springfield, Ohio newspaper.
The article had portrayed me as a 'UFO skeptic' who questioned the possibilities
of extraterrestrial visitations.
<p>"I'm listening," I replied to the caller, expecting an outlandish or
delusional account to commence. To my surprise, the gentleman on the other
end of the line sounded cognizant, sane and knowledgeable.
<p>"A friend of mine was an employee at Monsanto Research Corporation,
on Nicholas Road near Dayton, Ohio..."
<p><i><tt><font size=+2>Interesting Interview</font></tt></i>
<p>The caller, who claimed to be formely of the military, and I had agreed
to meet for lunch at a restaurant south of Dayton, Ohio within two weeks.
<p>I had contacted two acquaintances, Carla and Lois, who shared my interest
in accounts of the bizarre, and we all thought it intriguing to meet the
informant and receive his news.
<p>We left Cincinnati with plenty of time to spare, and reaching the Dayton
area an hour before our appointment, decided to venture to The Monsanto
Research Complex, the focal-point of the drama.
<p>Having been given directions to the facility by the informant, we found
the complex easily. Situated near Interstate 75 south of Dayton, Ohio,
on Nicholas Road, the facility is now operating under the name of Quality
Chemical, and from the road appears to be several big, box- shaped buildings
surrounded by fencing. The top-halves of the windowless buildings are riddled
with air ducts, protruding ventilation shafts and metal railings.
<p><img SRC="MONSANT1.JPG" height=227 width=238 align=RIGHT>
<p>Approaching the main gate, a security guard put down his sandwhich and
hitched his pants up around his big belly. "Can I help you?"
<p>"I am conducting a research project on corporations in this area, and
was curious to know if this facility was once called Monsanto Research?"
I asked just to break the ice, even though I already knew the answer.
<p>"Yes it was, several years ago."
<p>"Do you know what type of research projects were done here?" I asked,
hoping for something juicy.
<p>"Nope, but it was some classified project from Wright Patterson Air
Force Base."
<p>Carla and Lois thanked the security officer after we had gleaned everything
possible from him (including details of several large fires occurring years
prior). Driving away, we were unanimously impressed by the statement from
the watchman regarding a classified Air Force project. Even though unaware
of the specific activities performed at the facility he was guarding, the
officer had provided 'soft corroboration' of Air Force affiliation, an
affiliation we were now on our way to verify through the offerings of a
mysterious whistle-blower who would later be known as 'The Phantom Informant.'
<p>We met the gentleman as he waited in his car outside the restaurant.
Parking next to him, we greeted one another and entered the restaurant.
Telling the gentleman of our recent experience with the security guard,
he smiled with a self-assured grin and said, "That's interesting."
<p><img SRC="MONSANT2.JPG" height=275 width=392 align=LEFT>
<p>"Tell us about this friend of yours," came the question from Carla after
food was ordered.
<p>"He's dead, now... but he used to work at Monsanto and had a security
clearance," said the former miltary officer. "Evidently, as the story goes,
parts and components from a flying saucer was taken to the Monsanto and
kept there for a number of years. The situation was kept quiet, and suprisingly,
extensive security precautions had been deemed unnecessary. The low-intensity
security provided a good cover for the highly classified project."
<p>"Where did this flying saucer come from?" came the next obvious question.
<p>"I don't know, but we've all heard stories about Roswell," said the
informant as he sought to deflect the anxious questions and stay on his
point. "Anyhow, there were a number of other operations at the facility
that had also been going on, and there had been several accidents over
the years. One involved a chemical explosion which resulted in a large
fire."
<p>Carla chanced a quick glance to Lois, recalling the earlier statement
from the security guard.
<p>"One particular accident occurred as a result of experimentation with
gravity waves. This person was injured and taken to the Miami Valley Hospital
where he was held a while for observation. He was released later in the
evening, but for a while he was said to be disoriented.
<p>"Much of the reverse-engineering research was regarding gravity waves.
In fact, at one point, I was told of a rod or baton-like instrument that
could be pointed at a heavy block of concrete... When they would point
this rod at the block, they could lift it up into the air... almost magically.
<p>"There was also some nuclear materials that were produced at the location,
and they were taken discretely by the truckload to Jackass Flats for burial
and disposal. The whole facility was contaminated at one time."
<p>"Did this contamination have anything to do with the components?" I
asked, trying to home-in on the UFO discussion.
<p>"I'm sure some of it could have," he replied with uncertainty, giving
us the impression that he wasn't seemingly a 'know-it-all.'
<p>"But the real story is the man that came in."
<p><img SRC="MONSANT3.JPG" height=279 width=344 align=RIGHT>
<p><i><tt><font size=+2>Mysterious Visitor</font></tt></i>
<p>"According to my late friend, apparently there was a certain person
who visited Monsanto under armed escort. He had paid numerous visits, about
a half-dozen times from the late sixties to the early seventies. This well-dressed
person had a security clearance to get in, and was allowed to interact
with the employees there."
<p>The term "INTERACT" caused eyebrows to raise, as The Phantom Informant
paused to allow his enigmatic comment to sow the seed of curiousity.
<p>"He talked to them," the informant clarified, "but he wasn't a regular
person. This individual would talk with the workers and discuss certain
matters about routine job duties and inspections, and more cryptically,
would discuss matters about their own personal lives. He knew things he
wasn't supposed to know."
<p>"What do you mean 'he wasn't a regular person'?" asked Carla intensely.
<p>"I mean he wasn't a regular person. He looked normal, just like you
or me, even wore a nice business suit, but he wasn't a regular person.
He had talked to the people, and when he did, he ruined them. He knew things
he shouldn't have. He talked with my friend, and whatever he said that
day traumatized him for the rest of his life. His widow told me that from
that day forward he sat up on the edge of his bed at nights... in a cold
sweat, and wondered about that man. He said 'that man knew everything about
me."
<p>"Everything."
<p>With a meaningful stare, the informant emphasized his point and gazed
at Lois and Carla with a hypnotic assurance.
<p>"He knew certain unthinkable details about each person that nobody else
could."
<p>The Phantom Informant seemed to relish holding his captive audience
under his spell. Breaking his rhythym, I broke in, "Are you saying this
was an alien?"
<p>"I don't know," he huffed as he looked downward and talked in my direction
without making eye-contact, as if half-angry that I made such a suggestion.
"All I'm saying is that he wasn't a regular person."

<p><img SRC="MONSANT4.JPG" height=197 width=382>
<p><tt><font color="#00FFFF">According to the informant, 'parts and components'
of an exotic and unknown technology were taken from Wright-Patterson Air
Force Base in Dayton, Ohio, and reverse-engineered at The Monsanto Research
Lab on Nicholas Road under light security. The parts were duplicated there
and taken elsewhere for re-assembly.</font></tt></center>

<p>Not satisfied with gleaning these details from a second-hand source,
I sought after more details of the deceased gentleman in question. I was
told that the wife of this worker talked to the informant on plenty of
occassions, for they had been acquaintances through their mutual association
with the worker, and continue to talk years after the death of the worker.
<p>After his passing, the wife told the informant that her husband would
suffer sleepless nights, agonizing in a mixed state of disbelief and fear.
The wife had told of the problems the worker had for years after encountering
the mysterious stranger, and had been greatly disturbed. She felt that
he had an almost obsessive fear of the man. He talked of the good and honest
character of his friend, and told of how his wife would be hesitant to
discuss this issue, which she deemed 'sensitive.'
<p>The informant did not reveal whether he had an occasion to meet this
shadowy figure. He did allow that any worker was forevermore effected by
the well-dressed visitor, who held great power and abilities. At one point
in the discussion, he stated that he couldn't be sure if this person was
part of the government or the military, but knew that this was a very 'powerful'
individual, and briefly wondered 'where this individual is today.'
<p>During the conversation, both Carla and Lois became entranced by the
stories, as the informant spoke with methodological assurance, and closed
each sentence with uncanny and unnerving eye-contact.
<p>The account, if true, remains unverifiable at present, eluding that
special corroborative element which would advance this tale above the realms
of rumor, hearsay or even disinformational fiction. The bizarre tale of
the reverse-engineered parts and components from The Monsanto Research
Complex may simply be another piece in a warped and convoluted puzzle that
is too strange to be true, and if true, too difficult to believe.

<p><tt><font color="#00FFFF">September 9, 1997</font></tt>
<p><tt><font color="#00FFFF">Dear Mr. Curtis Nielsen;</font></tt>
<p><tt><font color="#00FFFF">This letter is regarding our investigations
of a special project which is said to have been handled at your facility
a number of years ago when it was operated by the Monsanto Research Corporation.</font></tt>
<p><tt><font color="#00FFFF">We have spoken with a gentleman who advised
that parts and components of an aircraft "of unknown origin" had been delivered
to the Nicholas Road facility under a special contract from Wright- Patterson
Air Force Base, where these parts and components had been reverse-engineered
and tested. The components, which were said to have been from a crash-landed
object, were duplicated at the Monsanto/Nicholas Road facility and then
re-assembled at another location.</font></tt>
<p><tt><font color="#00FFFF">We have been advised that an employee sustained
a serious injury during one experimental procedure, and was taken to Miami
Valley Hospital for observation.</font></tt>
<p><tt><font color="#00FFFF">Furthermore, a current employee of your facility
has acknowledged to some of our associates that at one time, a highly classified
Air Force contract from Wright-Patterson Air Force Base had been ongoing
at the Nicholas Road facility for a number of years. He stated that he
'couldn't discuss the project,' but described accidental explosions and
chemical fires which related to the project.</font></tt>
<p><tt><font color="#00FFFF">This letter to your office is to ask if you
had knowledge of - or could clarify the above accounts. Would there be
any way you could refer me to others who may also assist with my inquiries,
and how might we also acquire the medical documents regarding the job-related
injury relevant to the classified project? In addition, could you please
advise as to the nature of the activities conducted at the Nicholas Road
facility during the 1960 and 1970s time-frame, and where the records might
be stored? Does the present Quality Chemical operation retain documents
or information relevant to previous accidents/fires and work-related injuries?</font></tt>
<p><tt><font color="#00FFFF">Our investigations seek to acquire statements
from both Quality Chemical and Monsanto Research regarding this matter,
as those who have expressed this information also convey great concern
about these projects and their implications. In addition, We would be happy
to respect any requests for anonymity if privacy concerns are expressed.</font></tt>
<p><tt><font color="#00FFFF">Could you please reply by Fax at your earliest
convenience to: 513-351-4951</font></tt>
<p><tt><font color="#00FFFF">Your help with this serious inquiry is deeply
appreciated.</font></tt>
