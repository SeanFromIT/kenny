Evidently, Mike had filed an on-line<br>UFO sighting report on the W.U.F.O.D. database concerning a<br>mysterious object seen by several people near his home on<br>Saturday, January 13.<p>Jean, who works for the local school system, had answered the<br>phone first. She confirmed being a witness to the event and added<br>that she had repeatedly called Channel 12 news concerning a<br>'bright orange streak' that held stationary in the sky directly<br>overhead. This object was defined as having a bright<br>'neon-colored' luminescence that repeatedly brightened and<br>dimmed.<p>She said that her family first became aware of the event when her<br>husband, Todd XXXXX, was taking the dogs out. She added that<br>her husband routinely looks into the sky and enjoys looking at<br>the stars because he formerly worked for NASA. Upon observing the<br>object, he summoned their attention to it.<p>Jean's son Mike, who filed the W.U.F.O.D. report, came to the<br>phone and said that in all, there were 6-witnesses to the event<br>that he is aware of.<p>From their residence at XXX XXXXXX Lane, Mike and 5-others<br>stood out in their driveway and watched the streak-like object<br>hold stationary for a lengthy duration. He speculated that the<br>object was holding its position at a very high elevation and was<br>twice the size of his thumbnail held at arm's length. Our<br>conversation focused for several minutes on its size and Mike<br>reaffirmed that it was an estimated 2-inches at arm's length.<p>He described this object as resembling a 'comet streak' but with<br>no distinct head or tail, being brighter in the middle part of<br>it. This brightness in the center of the streak was described as<br>a dull blue color, with each edge fading into the neon orange<br>color with a soft gradiation.<p>Mike also reaffirmed that the object was almost directly<br>overhead and described the atmospheric conditions as relatively<br>clear with high whispy clouds. He said that occasionally the<br>object would be obstructed by cloud cover, but its glow could be<br>seen behind the clouds. He also said that there would be breaks<br>in the clouds were the object could be seen clearly.<p>Mike said that he did not have any film for his camera and has<br>no video capability, but did observe the object through<br>binoculars. Looking at it through binoculars, he said that he<br>could see a second, fainter object to the north of the main<br>object. This smaller object was a faint blue color.<p>He said that they watched the news for the next several nights,<br>expecting to hear something. He decided to file the W.U.F.O.D.<br>report from his online computer at his place of employment.<p>COMMENTS<p>I find Mike and Jean to be stable and reliable eyewitnesses.<br>While I accept that some observational detail may be flawed by<br>misperception or communication difficulties, I have no problem<br>accepting the possibility that they may have observed something<br>unusual. This is a strange description for a UFO but not<br>unprecedented, especially for Ohio (numerous claims of 'comet<br>shaped' UFOs on file).<p>I asked Mike about the position of the moon and he didn't recall<br>there being a visible moon at the time. Further exploration of<br>the moon's position will be necessary in consideration of this<br>report.<p>There have been several sightings of UFOs in this area in the<br>past year. In August, one person reported a UFO near Springboro,<br>Ohio and in April of 2001 several police officers observed a UFO<br>near Waynesville, Ohio. In response to this sighting, the Warren<br>County 9-1-1 dispatch placed calls to Wilmington airport and<br>Wright Patterson Air Force Base.<p>Monroe, Ohio is less that 29-miles south of WPAFB.<p>Filed,<br>January 28, 2002<br>KENNY YOUNG<p>NOTE: The full report of this was submitted to Bill Jones, State<br>Director for Ohio M.U.F.O.N.<p>TO SEE AN ILLUSTRATION OF THE SIGHTING, <a href="https://kenny.anomalyresponse.com/MONROEuFO.jpg">CLICKHERE</a></body></html>
