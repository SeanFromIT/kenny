<CENTER><P><FONT COLOR="#FFFF00"><FONT SIZE=-1>Due to the statement regarding
the Ohio Flare Explanation for a number of UFO sightings from March 26,
1997 which may also explain Arizona, , certain outrage has ensued, the
likes of which we have never seen before. Below is a sampling of livid
E-mail (and also some kinder, gentler E-mail) that came in fast and furious
after the flare announcement. </FONT></FONT>

<P><FONT COLOR="#FF0000"><FONT SIZE=-1>Dear Kenny,</FONT></FONT></P>

<P><FONT COLOR="#FF0000"><FONT SIZE=-1>You are wasting your time comparing
the Arizona sightings to flares. No way, no how. Are you telling me that
thousands of people are lying? Many people could see the actual structure
of the &quot;boomerang&quot; and the &quot;black triangle&quot;. How does
that fit into the T.A.S.K. flare theories? How did flares fly thru several
states?</FONT></FONT></P>

<P><FONT COLOR="#FF0000"><FONT SIZE=-1>What happened in Arizona was a low
fly over by alien spacecraft..Period...</FONT></FONT></P>

<P><FONT COLOR="#00FFFF"><FONT SIZE=-1>What a load of crap!! Eyewitnesses
in Arizona report an object that flew silently over their neigborhoods
at an altitude low enough to hit the object with a tennis ball. Daytime
sightings of similar objects (and hockey-puck shaped objects, as well)
confirm that at least some of 'em WERE NOT FLARES. That has, and will continue
to be, my mantra as long as folks like &quot;KENNY&quot; continue their
efforts to squeeze a square peg into a round hole. They can ask whomever
they like. I can assure them that the military was NOT dropping potentially
flammable objects over downtown Phoenix on the end of a parachute on the
night of the March 13th. </FONT></FONT></P>

<P><FONT COLOR="#00FFFF"><FONT SIZE=-1>Regardless of how ubiquitous these
maneuvers may be. What everyone seems to be forgetting here is the duration
of these sightings: up to an hour, according to news sources. Unless those
flares were made of plutomium, then so much for that theory. As the air-traffic
controller who witnessed these objects said to refute HIMSELF on NBC recently,
&quot;they were probably flares, but on the same plane and the same distance
from each other?&quot; </FONT></FONT></P>

<P><FONT COLOR="#00FFFF"><FONT SIZE=-1>Now, no less a personage than the
Governor of Arizona is calling for an investigation, a serious request
apparently, despite his cartoon antics. Gee, you'd think that he'd know
if they were flares or not, huh? Especially sense they had the potential
to make his fire-cracker hot town a little warmer. Maybe he KNOWS they
weren't and that's why he's calling for an investigation. I mean, the military
has said as much. I suppose they're just covering up for the next time
they want to drop napalm on his largest city. </FONT></FONT></P>

<P><FONT COLOR="#00FFFF"><FONT SIZE=-1>Oh, and while I'm on the subject.
I've heard that Richard Motzer is now claiming (sorry Rich if I've heard
incorrectly) that since computer enhancement shows that these lights bob
around a bit in relationship to one another, then that's further proof
that they are flares. Oh really? Has he never seen the video footage compiled
by Lee Elder of multiple discs (20 an up) hanging in the air over Mexico?
The ones bobbing ever so slightly in relationship to one another...almost
like balloons on a string. But they're not folks, they're not, regardless
of how much we'd like them to be... </FONT></FONT></P>

<P><FONT COLOR="#00FFFF"><FONT SIZE=-1>We don't know for sure if the 6
or so lights photographed over downtown Phoenix were interconnected or
not. Just because some people reported seeing a triangular shaped object(s)that
night doesn't mean that they were one and the same. But to maintain that
they were smoke, coming from flares, observed by thousands of people for
up to an hour is laughable. </FONT></FONT></P>

<P><FONT COLOR="#00FFFF"><FONT SIZE=-1>By the way...as State Director for
MUFON in Kentucky, I can promise you Kenny that the object that glided
silently over the apartment building in Lexington last month in front of
a number of witnessess wasn't smoke either. Neither were the blackish,
unmarked, helicopters that buzzed the building the following day and night,
even at 3:00 AM in the morning!! </FONT></FONT></P>

<P><FONT COLOR="#00FFFF"><FONT SIZE=-1>Bright, intelligent, well-meaning
people can jump to erroneous conclusions. This we know. Like that poor
soul over in Great Britain who's squandered a substantial amount of his
time and resources trying to pin the crop-circles on some very creative
wind vortices. Or the learned folks who tried to pin them on some horny
badgers. These folks deserve our, well, pity because they're so clueless.
But those who attempt to throw up a deliberate smoke-screen because of
their inability to &quot;cope&quot; (and you know who you are), deserve
our scorn. And nothing less. </FONT></FONT></P>

<P><FONT COLOR="#FFFF00"><FONT SIZE=-1>I don't know where to start with
your FLARE theory: Tim Edwards just told me that TWO Flare experts with
40 years in the business said the Phoenix sightings WERE NOT FLARES: Just
watching those Phoenix's UFOs on video tape and their extreme rapid motion
would, I think, rule out any type of Flare Theory. </FONT></FONT></P>

<P><FONT COLOR="#FFFF00"><FONT SIZE=-1>Now, those F16s in Ohio could have
been dropping flares at the same time as these reported UFO sightings so
you have a mix of flares and UFOS: Does everybody think the same there
?? This and our brilliant Kent Jeffreys are in the same boat....No Where

<P><FONT COLOR="#FF0000"><FONT SIZE=-1>They were dropping flares to confuse

<P><FONT COLOR="#FF0000"><FONT SIZE=-1>I saw two dark triangles. There
was no mistake. There they were, hovering directly over my house and making

<P><FONT COLOR="#00FF00"><FONT SIZE=-1>Kenny,</FONT></FONT></P>

<P><FONT COLOR="#00FF00"><FONT SIZE=-1>I can't believe you are seriously
considering flares as a possible explanation. Bob has an awfully good point.
I suppose those flares have been abducting people all over Ohio, too?</FONT></FONT></P>

<P><FONT COLOR="#00FF00"><FONT SIZE=-1>I really don't mean to criticize
you Kenny, but I feel you totally ignore some of the evidence, i.e. abduction
reports. I would like to know if there has been a significant increase
in this type of event coinciding with the increase in the visual sightings
in Ohio. Do you (or anyone have) this data? If not, I think we should be
trying to collect it. It is worth looking at.</FONT></FONT></P>

<P><FONT COLOR="#00FFFF"><FONT SIZE=-1>Dear Kenny,</FONT></FONT></P>

<P><FONT COLOR="#00FFFF"><FONT SIZE=-1>It boils down to this. I saw the
Strange lights and videotaped them. I also have videotaped and photographed
&quot;flares&quot;. My statement is: flares are not what we saw on March
13. The visual and videotaped evidence isn't the same. Further more I know
of no witness who states he saw flares. This includes current military
witnesses.</FONT></FONT></P>

<P><FONT COLOR="#00FFFF"><FONT SIZE=-1>So are you and T.A.S.K. calling
me and Bill Hamilton a bunch of liars?</FONT></FONT></P>

<P><FONT COLOR="#00FFFF"><FONT SIZE=-1>Now, we don't go around advertising
how the Ohio sightings were the boomerang craft from Arizona cruised over
Ohio. You guys are way out of line.</FONT></FONT></P>

<P><FONT COLOR="#E3E3E3"><FONT SIZE=-1>Hi Kenny,</FONT></FONT></P>

<P><FONT COLOR="#E3E3E3"><FONT SIZE=-1>First of all, I've stayed out of
the arguments because in most cases we're killing one another over distant
encounters. For those involved or informed about the Phoenix sightings,
however, your comparison may seem a little unfair to them. I would almost
agree with your concept, except that I just got off the phone with Peter
Davenport of the National UFO Reporting Center in Seattle. He will be posting
a report on the events in Phoenix. Whether we like it or not (and up until
an hour ago I was convinced on the flares) we have something very strange
going on over Arizona. There may have INDEED been flares, but something
else was there that is not easily explained.</FONT></FONT></P>

<P><FONT COLOR="#E3E3E3"><FONT SIZE=-1>Also, just brought to my attention,
flares with parachutes would not be dropped in that kind of area, and no
chutes were ever found.</FONT></FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=-1><I><FONT COLOR="#FF0000">Ken, my man, your word speaks
the truth! Don't let these inhumane smart-alecs ruffle your feathers.Fly
like the &quot;phoenix&quot; that you are! First the age of Aquarius, now
the dawning of the age of the Phoenix, she must arise from the ashes.The
summer solstace is at our doorstep. Whenever I see Mount Rainier I remember
that fifty years ago something happened here. Newspapers all over the world
were carrying the story of nine mysterious flying objects seen by Kenneth
Arnold on June 24th, 1947, over Washington's Cascade mountains. Hundreds
of others also witnessed this miraculous event. Shortly afterward, the
first week of July, the infamous Roswell crash occured.Whoever or whatever
it was, we are now invited to welcome its presence, trusting in ourselves,
the unknown and unknowable! Keep on truckin' brotherman!</FONT></I><FONT COLOR="#FFFF00">

<P><FONT COLOR="#FF8000"><FONT SIZE=-1>Your recent Net article, which attempted
to debunk the Ohio sightings with reported information from the very government
which has been covering up the UFO phenomena, was itself not very credible.
That you then attempted to debunk the Arizona sightings by analogy to the
Ohio sightings, leads me to believe that your reasoning is just as Fuzzy
as the reasoning to the &quot;True believers&quot; you attempt to denigrate.
In addition, your attempts to label those who choose not to believe the
government's line, as something akin to simple village idiots only detracts
from your reasoning.</FONT></FONT></P>

<HR WIDTH="100%"></P>

<P><FONT COLOR="#00FF00"><FONT SIZE=-1>I agree with you on science, but
the evidence here in Phoenix is that it points away from the Flare explanation.
There were no flares over Phoenix that night according to the National
Guard. We also had flare experts testify that they did not see flares that
night. A flare maker said that the analyzed images on the videos are not
flares. I saw the lights thru a telescope - no parachutes, no aircraft,
no smoke, no flames or sparks hence no flares. I am familiar with military
flares and have seen them often. The college boys from Cal Tech used to
try to fool us, but we just did not fool that easy. We have seen these
over MOAs and they illuminate the terrain for night ops. These lights illuminated
nothing! They may as well have been shining out of a black hole.</FONT></FONT></P>

<P><FONT COLOR="#FFFF00"><FONT SIZE=-1>KENNY,</FONT></FONT></P>

<P><FONT COLOR="#FFFF00"><FONT SIZE=-1>Perhaps the Arizona and Ohio Sightings
were a combination of Overlay.</FONT></FONT></P>

<P><FONT COLOR="#FFFF00"><FONT SIZE=-1>&quot;Another deeper understanding
is revealed as one examines this pattern. Every year there appear UFO reports
that go beyond terrestrial technology. I believe that our military is aware
of this and has a contingency plan in place. When a truly authentic sighting
occurs, the wheels of overlay begin to turn immediately.</FONT></FONT></P>

<P><FONT COLOR="#FFFF00"><FONT SIZE=-1>Before too much attention is drawn
to the REAL sighting, the Black Project boys are flying in our craft to
divert and draw away researchers and reporters to another location not
far away from the original sight(usually by a secure facility) in order
to distract and confuse the truth. For researchers, hot on the trail as
hound dogs; the dead end comes with an off limits area or hoaxed crop circle.
In either case, the truth gets diluted, and on most occasions, lost.</FONT></FONT></P>

truth for power, there can be no peace. For those who are willing to sacrifice
power for truth, eternity will not hide their honor!&quot; </FONT></FONT></P>

<IMG SRC="pencil.gif" HEIGHT=50 WIDTH=50></LI>
</UL>

<DIV ALIGN=right><P><I><FONT COLOR="#FFFF00"><FONT SIZE=-1>There has been
vehement opposition to the flare theory, primarily from <BR>
those who contend that the Ohio and Arizona happenings are E.T. related
events.<BR>
Here is a sampling of various reasoning used to justify the flare explanation.</FONT></FONT></I></P></DIV>

<P>
<HR WIDTH="100%"></P>

<P><FONT COLOR="#FFFF00"><FONT SIZE=-1>Please be informed that over 9 months
of time-consuming research has been applied into this investigation, and
the flare explanation is not meant to deflate or dismiss these events,
or the possibilities of ET visitation to earth. By objectively investigating
and reporting on these events, it is my singular motivation to convey fact.
</FONT></FONT></P>

<P><FONT COLOR="#FFFF00"><FONT SIZE=-1>I believe we, as UFO investigators
and sincere TRUTH SEEKERS, owe the public an honest effort in our quest
to unravel the UFO mystery. The flare theory is a viable explanation to
offer for these and other events. There is no denying the controversies
and witness discrepancies, but yet it is misleading to throw out this valuable
data when researching the reported happenings.</FONT></FONT></P>

<P><FONT COLOR="#FFFF00"><FONT SIZE=-1>I do not believe in throwing out
certain data that would damage our pet theories. Were I to disregard these
known findings in the face of the present publicity furor, then I would
be guilty of utlizing the very pigeon-hearted tactics used by the debunking
celebrities. If this data does not conform to our personal world views,
then we must all deal with it in our own way, but please don't discount
the possibilities. Keep in mind our intention: to advance an adequate explanation
to a reported anomalous event. At this stage of the game, the FLARE THEORY
meets this criteria. </FONT></FONT></P>

<P><FONT COLOR="#FFFF00"><FONT SIZE=-1>I have personally investigated 12
Ohio cases in the past 3 years and am satisfied that a core of these reports
remain unexplained. However, the March 26th Ohio event does not fall within
this category. I am very comfortable in stating that some of the objects
sighted on March 26th were flares. </FONT></FONT></P>

<P><FONT COLOR="#FFFF00"><FONT SIZE=-1>Again, I'm not in this to 'butter
up' the belief system of the ET believer, and I will also not withhold
my findings to protect any belief system.</FONT></FONT></P>

<P><FONT COLOR="#FFFF00"><FONT SIZE=-1>I would ask every UFO researcher
to share our commitment: discard your belief system and conduct UFO research
with unshakable objectivity, sincere scrutiny and honest reportage, never
fearing to publicize findings that may be in deviation of your world-view.</FONT></FONT></P>

<P><FONT COLOR="#FFFF00"><FONT SIZE=-1>Only then will the truth be unravelled.</FONT></FONT></P>

<P><FONT COLOR="#00FFFF"><FONT SIZE=-1>On 23 June 1997, Chris Rutkowski
wrote:</FONT></FONT></P>

<P><FONT COLOR="#00FFFF"><FONT SIZE=-1>Standing off to one side a bit,
I can see where both sides are coming from on this issue. And I will note
that they both raise some very good points. As an astronomer, I know only
too well that the odds are greatly in favour of there being sentient life
elsewhere in the universe (I doubt that there is such here on Earth, but
that's another matter...). </FONT></FONT></P>

<P><FONT COLOR="#00FFFF"><FONT SIZE=-1>In my talks about this subject,
I note the theories of stellar evolution and exobiology, including the
Drake equation and other calculations. I try to help formulate answers
to Fermi's classic &quot;Where are they?&quot; I tend to agree that the
ETH is a viable explanation for some UFO cases. I also agree, though, that
the number of cases to which this might apply is very, very small and that
the ETH is invoked much more often than is warranted.</FONT></FONT></P>

<P><FONT COLOR="#00FFFF"><FONT SIZE=-1>As Jenny Randles notes in the 50th
anniversary book &quot;UFO 1947-1997&quot;, one basic tenet of ufology
is: &quot;If you can't explain 9 out of 10 sightings, you're not trying
hard enough.&quot; </FONT></FONT></P>

<P><FONT COLOR="#00FFFF"><FONT SIZE=-1>Kenny's refutation that the Arizona
flap was due to a formation of some aircraft seems eminently reasonable
to me, judging from the descriptions and comments that have been posted,
including the video. I've had some cases that were similar, too. The fact
that the &quot;dark&quot; UFO was implied by the position of lights makes
me more than a bit suspicious of the incident, too. The fallability of
witnesses' observational capabilities is well-documented and it seems more
reasonable to think the focus of the Arizona case might be better explained
as military activity (not necessarily flares, BTW) rather than a giant
extraterrestrial mothership. </FONT></FONT></P>

<P><FONT COLOR="#00FFFF"><FONT SIZE=-1>This is *not* to say that the ETH
sbould be ignored, only that ufologists should be very careful in interpreting
and evaluating sighting reports. I've been called a skeptic by some hard-core
&quot;believers&quot; because of my caution, and I think this is what Kenny
was getting at. But I've also argued *against* CSICOP members regarding
the UFO issue, giving some the opportunity to call me a &quot;believer.&quot;
In reality, I am neither. </FONT></FONT></P>

<P><FONT COLOR="#00FFFF"><FONT SIZE=-1>Hard-core believers *and* hard-core
debunkers are both controlled by deep-rooted belief systems which restrict
their world view and skew their thinking. If ufologists and other researchers
are not careful, their personal views can and will interfere with their
approaches to this subject. </FONT></FONT></P>

<P><FONT COLOR="#00FFFF"><FONT SIZE=-1>Paul Devereux's comments on another
ListServ which implied I was critical of his Earth Lights theory because
I was a firm believer in the ETH as the main UFO explanation only showed
how belief systems operate even among those who do not hold the ETH as
a main concept. He is unable to understand that Earth Lights are not needed
as an explanation within ufology except in very specific and rare cases
where other explanations such as aircraft and stars are more tenable. He
might be arguing now, I suppose, that the Arizona cases might have been
Earth Lights, and he *might* be correct! </FONT></FONT></P>

<P><FONT COLOR="#00FFFF"><FONT SIZE=-1>But when one steps back for a long,
cold look, you tend to see the forest as well as the trees. If you're lucky,
you can even see the mountain. </FONT></FONT></P>

<P><I><FONT COLOR="#FF0000"><FONT SIZE=-1>It was just flares. Some Christians
believe they can see the image of the virgin Mary in a potato. UFOERS believe
flares are Ufos. There was a press release a day before the sighting that
they were going to shoot off flares.</FONT></FONT></I></P>

It seems that MUFON is trying to create an alien hysteria over these flare
events. Where are the other UFO organizations, any comments from them?
It seems the media didn't care about this story that much the day after
it happen. Why now?</FONT></FONT></P>
