"There were someloud, blood-curdling screams but nobody could find out anything more."<p>I then asked if Dr. ((deleted)) if he knew anything about any UFO sightingand he said: "Yes, I saw it."<p>Dr. ((delted)) said that he was driving toward his home on Friday, November21 between 9 and 10:00 p.m. with his 2 sons, 15 and 18-years old (He recallsthe specific date, knowing that one son is in college and would not havebeen home any day except Friday).<p>While driving, they all spotted a soundless aerial object over a nearbyopen field that was described as an oval-shaped, white-colored light sourceas big as a pea held at arms length which moved 'like a hummingbird wouldmove.'<p>The object, seen in the dark and clear night skies, was relatively highwhen first seen and was "coming down, moving in increments as if an elevatorwould drop and stay there awhile, then drop and stay there awhile," Dr.((deleted)) said.<br><img SRC="adamslane.jpg" HSPACE=10 VSPACE=10 BORDER=0 height=250 width=416 align=LEFT><br>After the first 3 or 4 minutes of visual observation, the object beganmoving around to different parts of the sky. They got out of car to seeif they could identify this object and verified to their satisfaction thatthe object was not a plane, helicopter or aurora borealis.<p>"My first inclination was to rationalize what this object could havebeen," Dr. ((deleted)) said. "rather than jumping to conclusions. Afterwe ruled out the various possible explanations we assumed that this wasa UFO."<p>"I know for a fact that there was no explanation for this object andI'm just glad I had my two sons with me to see it," he said.<p>After observing this object for a few minutes, ((deleted)) and his 2sons got back in the car and drove on to their home under a certain senseof apprehension.<p>"I would say that our feeling was more a sense of apprehension thanfear," he said, "I did not know what it was we were looking at and hadsome concern that it might or could have spotted us."<p>After driving the short distance to their house, they went to a secondfloor bedroom and looked out the window to the northwest where they continuedtowatch the object. It descended lower toward the ground and seemed to besettling in a nearby field where its color had shifted from a white toan orange. As the object got lower and lower to the ground, it became biggerand its color changed to a reddish light.<p>He said that the size of the object increased from a pea at arms lengthto a dime at arms length, stressing that its size, from his perspective,was "not quite as drastic as a nickel at arms length."<p>"There was like a vacuum of silence while we watched this," ((deleted))said, "it was like everything was real quiet, at a standstill and thenwhen it became a red color, everything went crazy."<p>((deleted)) said that animals in the area suddenly erupted in a frenzy.His neighbors dog was barking crazily and his German Shepherd dog triedto break its chain.<p>From his perspective, the object descended to the ground but was notcertain that it touched or made contact with the ground as trees preventedhim from seeing this with certainty.<p>"At that point, after this object got red, it just "shot off" like adart, some kind of acceleration and it just took off to the west. We juststood there dumbfounded."<p>He said the sighting lasted for an estimated 10 to 15 minute duration.<p>"I was very reluctant to call the police about a UFO sighting," he said,"at that point, we were not going to report this."<p>"Right after that my 2-sons went back outside and heard the screaming.It was a female voice. They got in the car and within minutes had calledfrom their cell phone to say that they had been hearing screaming soundsin the field where this thing came down," he said.<p>"Approximately 20-minutes after the UFO sighting the police were atmy door, there were about 20 officers and a rescue squad over in the fieldwhere I spotted the UFO. They were combing the area and had asked me whatI knew about someone screaming."<p>"Apparently, others had heard the screaming sounds."<p>I asked ((deleted)) if he could explain what was heard and he emphasizedthat he did not hear the screaming sounds himself, that his 2 sons heardthe disturbing commotion, along with other residents in the area that notifiedlaw enforcement.<p>He paused from our conversation to check with one of his sons, askingif the son could recount the nature of the screaming sounds. He said itwas a desperate, blood curdling scream of a female voice that kept saying:"Help me, oh my God, help me!"<p>"Apparently several people had heard the screaming, I don't know howlong it lasted," he said.<p>When the police arrived at his doorstep knocking on his door (an estimated15 minutes after the UFO departed), he volunteered information about theUFO sighting.<p>"I took the officer to the side and explained to him that this is goingto sound crazy, but I need to tell you what I saw tonight."<p>"I told the police about the UFO after they came to the door, I don'tknow if anyone else saw the UFO but the officer taking my report took meseriously. He didn't write anything down while I talked with him," he said.<p>When asked if the police officer indicated that anyone else had alsowitnessed the UFO, ((deleted)) said that the police officer said he hadseen a UFO also, but was uncertain if he was referring to the same objector a separate, unrelated sighting.<p>((deleted)) said that aside from reporting this to the police officerwho knocked on his door, he had not reported this sighting to any otherperson and that he was not the source for the report which was submittedto The National UFO Reporting Center. He was puzzled how the report madeit to NUFORC and said that neither he, nor his sons, reported the sightingto anyone.<p>"I'm still trying to figure out who reported this," he said after ourconversation. He went on to say how he got "freaked out" when the copscame to the door asking about the screaming sounds.<p>He described the area of his residence as isolated and surrounded byfields and woodland. His road is paved. He emphasized that the screamingsounds came from the immediate area where the unidentified object had cameto the ground. "The screaming sounds came from the field, and I have noexplanation for it."<p>Dr. ((deleted)), who teaches psychology for the Ashland, Kentucky CommunityCollege branch of the University of Kentucky, also said that he had previouslyseen a UFO when he was in his Freshman year in college at Morehead StateUniversity in 1976. He said the object was similar to what he saw on Friday,November 21, 2003.<p>COMMENT<p>I am deeply impressed by ((deleted)) and his efforts to remain objectiveand rationalize various explanations about the sighting. Based on his observation,the object in question is nothing to do with Aurora Borealis or 'northernlights.'&nbsp; He did alllow permission to use his name and employmentin this report, having no objection to it attached with the UFO sightingand situation involving a search party near his home.&nbsp;<p>Information furnished by ((deleted)) sheds new light on this case. Commentsfrom him directly contradict the dismissive approach taken by law officersin remarks made during earlier inquiries (who also incorrectly advisedthat the event was on Sunday, November 23) regarding a UFO situation thatcorresponds with the screams.<p>When informed that a Morehead policeman and a fire rescue officer toldme that "someone had seen the northern lights," ((deleted)) scoffed atthe suggestion and was in disbelief.<p>"I can't believe they said that, this was definitely not the northernlights."<p>He said that tomorrow he will inspect the 50-acre field where the objectdescended.<p>The report to N.U.F.O.R.C. suggests that the UFO was also sighted bywitnesses with the rescue squad responding to the scene. This might suggestthat the screaming sound was heard simultaneous to the visual sightingof the UFO. Peter Davenport of N.U.F.O.R.C. states: "The person who submittedthe sighting report for Morehead, KY, provided no personal or contact information,to include no e-address.&nbsp; It "reads" as if it was submitted by a memberof the team that was dispatched, i.e. it reads as if someone just copieda written record of the dispatch.&nbsp; I would have responded to the report,save for the absence of any means of contacting the source."<p>That report states: "Morehead-Rowan Co. Rescue Sq.had a call from MPDof a female crying for help x3. From 2 witness then there was a brightlight in the sky for about 1 min. RESCUE SQ.arrived on scene and startedsearching the area 1st &amp; 2nd witness reported seeing this .The firedept.was ask to begin searching with the thermal imaging camera with noresults found. Res. of Morehead was one of the witnesses. Unless thereis a confirmed report of a missing person, the search will not be continued."<p>The report of desperate, blood curdling screams from a woman crying"Help me, Oh God, Help me" mar this case with a disturbing sense of unusualdread. Clearly, there was a problem taking place and this report raisesthe specter of reported UFO/human abduction or interaction&nbsp;<p>Morehead, Kentucky is an estimated 45-miles south of Flemingsburg, Kentucky,where a crop formation appeared in a Rye Field in the spring of this year.A flap of crop formations and UFO sightings also bewildered Southern Ohioin the summer of 2003, and during this flap one strange account of a womanfound in a Southern Ohio soybean field is under investigative consideration.There is no certainty that this situation can be linked to the UFO or cropcircle flap aside from the chronological and regional closeness, but thewoman - who was hospitalized for a week after being found by a<br>farmer - reportedly experienced amnesia and did not know how she gotin the field. This matter is also held under<br>close consideration by researcher Donnie Blessing and will be pursuedfurther.<p>This present case of 'screaming sounds' from a female voice is linkedfirmly to the UFO sighting as per the same location in one specific fieldnear Adams Lane in Morehead, Kentucky and the '20 minute time frame' ofthe conclusion of the UFO sighting to the arrival of officers involvedin the search and rescue operation.<p>Special thanks to Donnie Blessing, Peter Davenport<p>Filed,<br>November 30, 2003<br>KENNY YOUNG<br>--<br>UFO Research<br>https://home.fuse.net/ufo<p><hr WIDTH="100%"><center><p><b><font face="Arial,Helvetica"><a href="https://kenny.anomalyresponse.com/moreheadindex.html">RETURNTO THE MOREHEAD INCIDENT INDEX PAGE</a></font></b><p><hr WIDTH="100%"><p><b><font face="Arial,Helvetica">UFO RESEARCH</font></b><br><b><font face="Arial,Helvetica"><a href="https://home.fuse.net/ufo">Returnto MAIN PAGE</a> |&nbsp; <a href="mailto:anomalyresponse@gmail.com">E-mail Questionsor Comments</a></font></b></center></td></tr></table></center><br>&nbsp;<br>&nbsp;</body></html>
