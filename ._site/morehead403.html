I asked Nancy if she could tell me more about what was said onthe police scanner the night of the screaming woman incident. Mrs. Huffsaid that Nancy was at a basketball game and I then asked if she knew anythingabout the incident.</font></b><b><font face="Arial,Helvetica"></font></b><p><b><font face="Arial,Helvetica">Mrs. Huff said that her husband wasa volunteer with the Fire and Rescue squad and that he told her a callhad came into the station from someone saying that they saw 'a woman witha baby' that was walking around on a hill, and that 'a spaceship' camedown and took the baby and the woman began to scream.&nbsp;&nbsp;</font></b><b><font face="Arial,Helvetica"></font></b><p><b><font face="Arial,Helvetica">Mrs. Huff then asked her husband ifit was a crazy woman who might have needed mental help and he said thathe did not know who it was.</font></b><b><font face="Arial,Helvetica"></font></b><p><b><font face="Arial,Helvetica">At this point I was shocked. I askedMrs. Huff to repeat what she said. There was a loudly crying child on herlap that made it hard to hear. She said that story is what was being passedaround at the station.&nbsp;</font></b><b><font face="Arial,Helvetica"></font></b><p><b><font face="Arial,Helvetica">I stumbled over my words while tryingto calmly asl if I could speak to her husband.&nbsp; Mrs. Huff said thathe was not home&nbsp; (he would not be home until about 9:30 P.M.).&nbsp;I asked if she thought he would talk to me about this and she said yes,that he would talk to me.&nbsp; She also said that her husband would knowthe time the call came in.&nbsp; I told her that I appreciated her talkingto me and that I would call back at 9:30.</font></b><b><font face="Arial,Helvetica"></font></b><p><b><font face="Arial,Helvetica">At 9:35 P.M. on December 3rd, 2003 Ispoke to a Mr. C. Huff (name withheld on file). Mr. Huff is a volunteerfor the Fire and Rescue squad in Morehead, Ky.</font></b><b><font face="Arial,Helvetica"></font></b><p><b><font face="Arial,Helvetica">Mr. Huff explained that he had beenlying on the bed listening to the scanner and had not been on duty thatday. He thought that the time was somewhere between 4-6 A.M.&nbsp;&nbsp;</font></b><b><font face="Arial,Helvetica"></font></b><p><b><font face="Arial,Helvetica">He went on to say that it was a manwho called and said that there was a woman in a field screaming.&nbsp;He did not know who the person was that called. I asked Mr. Huff if hewas totally certain that the time was between 4-6 A.M. and he said thathe would check and for me to call him tomorrow.</font></b><b><font face="Arial,Helvetica"></font></b><p><b><font face="Arial,Helvetica">Mr. Huff went on say that he had heardthat one person in the team searching for the screaming woman was approachedby a man while they were in the vicinity of the Kentucky State Patrol outpostand Skaggs Rd. This man walked over to one of the officers and stated thathe had seen the whole thing.&nbsp; He told the officer that he saw "a womanin a field and that a spaceship had came down and had taken the woman."</font></b><b><font face="Arial,Helvetica"></font></b><p><b><font face="Arial,Helvetica">I asked Mr. Huff if he could tell mewho this officer was and he stated he did not know.&nbsp; He did not knowif it was a police officer or a member of the rescue team.</font></b><b><font face="Arial,Helvetica"></font></b><p><b><font face="Arial,Helvetica">This was second hand information tohim.&nbsp; I asked if he could find out for me and he stated that he wouldnot be allowed to give the persons name or the officer's name.</font></b><b><font face="Arial,Helvetica"></font></b><p><b><font face="Arial,Helvetica">Mr. Huff went on to recount anotherincident that occurred one or two days after the report of the screamingwoman.&nbsp; He says that a woman had called the station to complain thata child about two years old had been seen walking down route 60 in Moorhead"wearing only a diaper."</font></b><b><font face="Arial,Helvetica"></font></b><p><b><font face="Arial,Helvetica">The woman had been returning home fromher niece's house, she had turned off Route 32 onto Rt. 60 headed westto Salt Lick when she spotted the child.&nbsp; She immediately called thepolice.&nbsp; When they arrived the child was gone. No missing child wasever reported according to Mr. Huff. Mr. Huff did not state if the womanhad left the scene where the child was to call the police. Further investigationinto this, I feel, is warranted.</font></b><b><font face="Arial,Helvetica"></font></b><p><b><font face="Arial,Helvetica">I then asked Mr. Huff if there was anythingelse he could offer on the incident of the screaming woman and he saidno.&nbsp; I thanked Mr. Huff for his time and told him I would call backto see if he had found the correct time of the call.</font></b><b><font face="Arial,Helvetica"></font></b><p><b><font face="Arial,Helvetica">COMMENTS</font></b><b><font face="Arial,Helvetica"></font></b><p><b><font face="Arial,Helvetica">Mr. And Mrs. Huff had different stories.There seemed to be some confusion as to where the baby fit into the story.&nbsp;I left all comments intact as reported to me since we do not have the fulltrue account yet.&nbsp;</font></b><b><font face="Arial,Helvetica"></font></b><p><b><font face="Arial,Helvetica">This case has escalated in intensity,being made that much more stranger by the alleged eyewitness sighting ofa woman being 'taken' by a UFO.</font></b><b><font face="Arial,Helvetica"></font></b><p><b><font face="Arial,Helvetica">Filed 12/03/03</font></b><br><b><font face="Arial,Helvetica">Donnie Blessing</font></b><br><b><font face="Arial,Helvetica">Southern Ohio Section Director MUFON</font></b><center><hr WIDTH="100%"><br><b><font face="Arial,Helvetica">UFO RESEARCH</font></b><br><b><font face="Arial,Helvetica"><a href="https://home.fuse.net/ufo">Returnto MAIN PAGE</a> |&nbsp; <a href="mailto:anomalyresponse@gmail.com">E-mail Questionsor Comments</a></font></b></center><br>&nbsp;</td></tr></table></center><br>&nbsp;<br>&nbsp;</body></html>
