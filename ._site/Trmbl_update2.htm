<P><FONT COLOR="#FFFF00"><FONT SIZE=+1>Trumbull County Investigation:<BR>
<I>Interview with <BR>
Howland Township police officer</I></FONT></FONT> </P>

<P><FONT COLOR="#FFFF00"><FONT SIZE=-1>I attempted to get more details
regarding the Howland officer who traveled to the airbase to confer with
a security guard regarding the December 14, 1994 UFO disturbance in Trumbull
County, Ohio. I called the Howland Township Police Department earlier in
the week (169 Niles Cortland RD NE, Warren, OH 44484 - phone: 330-856-5555)
and was told to call during the day (before 4:00 p.m.) and ask for Pat
from records.</FONT></FONT></P>

<P><FONT COLOR="#FFFF00"><FONT SIZE=-1>This afternoon I placed another
call to the Howland Township Police Department and talked with Pat, but
she transferred my call to Sergeant Compton when I explained the nature
of my call.</FONT></FONT></P>

<P><FONT COLOR="#FFFF00"><FONT SIZE=-1>Sgt. Compton, who spoke with me
next, could not locate any records relevant to this event, and said that
he had no knowledge of this incident. He did have familiarity with the
layout of the airbase, and said that the security staff there are employees
of The Department Of Defense. He further advised that the Air Force operates
at the base, and maintains the 910th Tactical Air Wing.</FONT></FONT></P>

<P><FONT COLOR="#FFFF00"><FONT SIZE=-1>Sgt. Compton informed that the facility
is commonly called The Vienna Airbase, which is an Air Force Reserve facility.
C-130 transport planes fly in and out of the base routinely. Two separate
entities use the same runway, the Youngstown/Warren Regional Airport and
the Vienna/U.S.A.F. Reserves. After midnight, there is 'no air traffic'
until morning. Usually, the facility is basically 'shut down' during the
over-night/early-morning hours.</FONT></FONT></P>

<P><FONT COLOR="#FFFF00"><FONT SIZE=-1>He expressed interest in the UFO
incident and I informed him of the unit number for the gentleman who, on
the tape, travelled to the airbase. He said he would look into the story
and call me back.</FONT></FONT></P>

<P><FONT COLOR="#FFFF00"><FONT SIZE=-1>After 2:00 p.m., Sgt. Compton telephoned
me to inform that I was on a 3-way speakerphone-conversation with the actual
officer who traveled to the airbase. Patrolman Hray discussed the incident,
and declared that the event was real, and the object in question was something
he could not identify.</FONT></FONT></P>

<P><FONT COLOR="#FFFF00"><FONT SIZE=-1>On the speakerphone with Patrolman
Hray and Sgt. Compton, I was asked to play a portion of the tape back to
them so they could hear the radio traffic. Hray confirmed that the voice
on the tape was his.</FONT></FONT></P>

<P><FONT COLOR="#FFFF00"><FONT SIZE=-1>Hray then gave some more information
on the incident. He said the object was definitely visible from the airbase,
at times appearing very low.</FONT></FONT></P>

<P><FONT COLOR="#FFFF00"><FONT SIZE=-1>The Howland Officer stressed that
he saw only one object, and didn't recall the event lasting a six-hour
duration as initially related. He said the duration of the incident was
'around a half-hour or so.'</FONT></FONT></P>

<P><FONT COLOR="#FFFF00"><FONT SIZE=-1>The officer told of how he was pursuing
the UFO, which he described as a bright light with no structure visible.
He could never seem to get near to the object, as it always moved away
when he approached. His pursuit of the object led him slightly out of his
jurisdiction, but he still proceeded to the airbase, where the UFO was
'close by.'</FONT></FONT></P>

<P><FONT COLOR="#FFFF00"><FONT SIZE=-1>Upon driving his police car up to
the airbase, the Howland police officer summoned the security guard from
his post and indicated the UFO to him. They both stood and viewed the object
for nearly five minutes. The object would appear rather close at times,
and would occasionally drop behind the trees.</FONT></FONT></P>

<P><FONT COLOR="#FFFF00"><FONT SIZE=-1>As relayed on the 9-1-1 tape, the
security guard could also not identify the strange object.</FONT></FONT></P>

<P><FONT COLOR="#FFFF00"><FONT SIZE=-1>The Howland police officer is unaware
if the security guard, a DOD employee, made a report on the incident, and
does not know the identity of the security guard.</FONT></FONT></P>

<P><FONT COLOR="#FFFF00"><FONT SIZE=-1>The Howland police officer felt
that the object, which was visible from the security post at the entrance
to the facility, should have been visible from the vantage point of the
FAA tower operator at his 70-foot elevation. When asked about the positioning
and visual capabilities of the FAA tower operator relevant to the UFO,
he said: &quot;I assume that he (the FAA tower operator) would have seen
it.&quot;</FONT></FONT></P>

<P><FONT COLOR="#FFFF00"><FONT SIZE=-1>The object was described as an extremely
bright, blue object. Other officers reported a structure or attachment
seen on the UFO, but the Howland officer informed of no structure or protruding
element seen on the object from his vantage point, and described the phenomenon
as 'good sized' and fairly bright, sometimes appearing pretty close to
his position.</FONT></FONT></P>

<P><FONT COLOR="#FFFF00"><FONT SIZE=-1>The officer stated that he had read
my report on the internet about one year earlier, and knew that I had investigated
the case.</FONT></FONT></P>

<P><FONT COLOR="#FFFF00"><FONT SIZE=-1>After the conversation, another
phone call from Sgt. Compton was received, and he asked that I send him
a copy of the tape. I told him that I would put it in the mail for him
tomorrow. When I asked if Patrolman Hray had reservations about discussing
the strange incident, he said that the officer did not mind speaking to
me about the Trumbull County UFO Disturbance.</FONT></FONT></P>
