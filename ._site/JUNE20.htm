<P><B><FONT COLOR="#FFFF00">ARIZONA UFO REPORTS ATTAINS NATIONAL COVERAGE,
OHIO EXPLANATION DISREGARDED</FONT> </B></P>

<P><FONT COLOR="#FFFF00"><FONT SIZE=-1>The nation-wide coverage of the
March 13, 1997 Phoenix, Arizona UFO sightings have intensified dramatically
over the past week, but the explanation for this and other events has failed
to yield the same amount of enthusiasm. </FONT></FONT></P>

<P><FONT COLOR="#FFFF00"><FONT SIZE=-1>Initially featured on the May 8
tabloid TV program EXTRA, the widespread reportage of the Arizona UFO sightings
launched anew earlier this week starting with the full page coverage in
USA Today on June 18th (Page A-4) with additional coverage by Peter Jennings
and Tom Brokaw. The Arizona happenings will be addressed tonight on HARD
COPY.</FONT></FONT></P>

<P><FONT COLOR="#FFFF00"><FONT SIZE=-1>This reportage will only accelerate
during the next two weeks as our country will celebrate 50 years of the
UFO phenomenon. </FONT></FONT></P>

<P><FONT COLOR="#FFFF00"><FONT SIZE=-1>However, little is known regarding
the Ohio sightings happening on March 26 two weeks after Arizona, and also
witnessed by thousands of people in Southern Ohio. The event was reported
to police dispatch centers and various news media agencies including The
Cincinnati Enquirer and WKRC Channel 12 News. The Cincinnati news media
have strangely not reported on the Ohio happenings.</FONT></FONT></P>

<P><FONT COLOR="#FFFF00"><FONT SIZE=-1>Calls poured in across a wide area
of Southern Ohio and through eight counties in the Cincinnati tri-state,
from Wilmington, Ohio to Maysville, Kentucky. This event parallels the
Arizona sightings in both mass-witness description of the reported phenomenon,
duration of event and time of day. However, it would only be honest and
responsible to announce that a prosaic answer to this mystery may be available.
</FONT></FONT></P>

<P><FONT COLOR="#FFFF00"><FONT SIZE=-1>T.A.S.K. investigators, through
dogged research, have advanced a viable explanation that would account
for the Ohio disturbances on March 26, and with further objective research,
this explanation may also apply to the Arizona event. T.A.S.K. investigator
Kenny Young pursued the story and concluded that the 178th Fighter Group
and 162nd Fighter Squadron Flying Unit Fighter Operations division from
Springfield Air National Guard base were conducting maneuvers across the
BUCKEYE MOA (Military Operating Area), which is a massive air corridor
across Southern Ohio. These training maneuvers utilize flares, which are
dispensed from F-16 jets for the purposes of attracting and diverting incoming
heat-seeking missiles. The heat signature of the flare lures the missile
away from the hot jet-engine target. Thousands of Ohioans mistook these
flares as UFOs for over 90 minutes on March 26. </FONT></FONT></P>

<P><FONT COLOR="#FFFF00"><FONT SIZE=-1>The confused witnesses described
such oddities as a massive triangular object which drifted silently over
Brown County, Ohio and Maysville, Kentucky, seen only by its brilliant
lights. Other persons from Hamilton, Clinton and Warren Counties, described
a row or formation of lights which would 'appear and disappear.' Almost
every witness added that military jets were in action during the event.</FONT></FONT></P>

<P><FONT COLOR="#FFFF00"><FONT SIZE=-1>Although a spokesman for Springfield
A.N.G. advised that the maneuvers pose no danger to the populace because
the flares "do not hit the ground," a fire and E.M.S. coordinator from
Clinton County observed a flare-like particle fall to earth near New Vienna,
Ohio. This fire official confirmed, "What I saw was a definite fire-threat."</FONT></FONT></P>

<P><FONT COLOR="#FFFF00"><FONT SIZE=-1>A similar sort of explanation may
also apply to the Arizona disturbance. A review of a videotape acquired
from an Arizona resident looks strikingly similar to a videotape recorded
from Waverly, Ohio (featured this week on SIGHTINGS, seen on the SCI-FI
channel), in which a formation of lights can be seen 'floating' in the
sky. It is our suspicion the images on the Arizona video could possibly
also be flares, due to the 'twinkling' effect and rate of burnout as seen
on the video, plus the jet-activity reported during the happening. The
Arizona happening may have utilized large 'parachute flares,' which could
be used for battefield illumination. In addition, the 'solid object' seen
behind the bright lights could have been smoke from the flares. The witnesses,
being confused by the spectacle, would interpret the oddity as a spaceship
from another planet.</FONT></FONT></P>

<P><FONT COLOR="#FFFF00"><FONT SIZE=-1>Numerous Ohio witnesses who have
been advised of our explanation to the March 26 disruption have been satisified
by our answers, although other witnesses continue to remain unconvinced.</FONT></FONT></P>

<P><FONT COLOR="#FFFF00"><FONT SIZE=-1>T.A.S.K. has conducted a telephone
interview with a Sergeant from Springfield A.N.G. for the television program
UFO UPDATE: LIVE! During the interview, the Sergeant advised the viewing
audience that these maneuvers were "rampant" across the country.</FONT></FONT></P>

<P><FONT COLOR="#FFFF00"><FONT SIZE=-1>We readily acknowledge that certain
observed characteristics described by witnesses to these events are incompatible
with the FLARE THEORY, but this is where our investigations are ongoing.
Such discrepancies can be addressed by witness error and misinterpretation
of such an unusual observation. </FONT></FONT></P>

<P><FONT COLOR="#FFFF00"><FONT SIZE=-1>The media is encouraged to inform
the public of the explanation to the Ohio disturbance, an explanation which
may also solve the Arizona sightings pending further meticulous investigation.</FONT></FONT></P>
