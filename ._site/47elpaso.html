<b><font face="Arial Narrow"><font size=+1>"Mysterious "falling objects"
reported near Tularosa and Eagle, New Mexico Friday (June 27, 1947) had
not been located or identified late Friday night. There were no rockets
fired from the White Sands Proving Ground Friday.</font></font></b><b><font face="Arial Narrow"><font size=+1></font></font></b>
<p><b><font face="Arial Narrow"><font size=+1>There was much conjecture
as to whether the falling objects had any relation to the mysterious flying
discs which had been variously reported seen recently from Oregon to Oklahoma.</font></font></b><b><font face="Arial Narrow"><font size=+1></font></font></b>
<p><b><font face="Arial Narrow"><font size=+1>Lt. Col. Harold R. Turner,
commanding officer at White Sands, said that he had received reports that
a track walker said he had seen a falling object near Eagle, New Mexico
and an Army captain flying his own plane reported seeing an object falling
from the skies near Tularosa. Search parties were sent out from White Sands
in attempts to locate the objects or secure additional information."</font></font></b><b><font size=+1></font></b>
