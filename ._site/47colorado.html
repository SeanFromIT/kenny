It looked for awhile as though the mystery of the flying discs was going
to be solved in Boulder County Thursday afternoon, but the soaring objects
which came to earth on a farm northeast of here proved to be balloons released
by the University of Denver for scientific research.
<p>The five balloons � one large one and four small ones attached to it
� carried instruments to check cosmic radiation at high altitudes. The
small balloons exploded with a loud report just before they came down on
Elmer Adnerson�s farm, known as the Spurgeon place, about three miles west
of Niwot, near Haystack mountain.
<p>Anderson notified the state highway patrol, as requested by the instructions
on the intrument�s box. Patrolman V.F. Eminger went to the scene and cut
loose the still-inflated big balloon, about 12 feet in diameter. It went
soaring away � perhaps to be seen later by someone who would mistake it
for a �flying disc.� Eminger and other highway patrolmen relayed the instruments
[text not legible] broken but generally in good condition back to Denver
University�s scientific bureau.
<p>The Camera received a call from the Nederland dam Thursday morning saying
that five balloons were overhead and drifting east.
