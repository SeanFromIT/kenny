sightings</FONT></FONT> <IMG SRC="UF1.jpg" HSPACE=12 VSPACE=12 HEIGHT=150 WIDTH=319 ALIGN=RIGHT></P>

<P><FONT COLOR="#00FFFF"><B>Subject:</B> Mike Stevens [changed for privacy
purposes, name and phone number on file]. &nbsp;Stevens reported a suspected
'Bigfoot sighting' to the Internet Bigfoot Database.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT COLOR="#00FFFF"><B>Time of event:</B> (specifics pending) 1997
Deer hunting season, Mid-day</FONT></P>

<P><FONT COLOR="#00FFFF"><B>Location: </B>Near Peebles, Ohio (Adams County)
on Davis Memorial Road (Across from the State Preserve [?]) One mile from
GE/Peebles Test Operation property line.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT COLOR="#00FFFF"><B>Description: </B>Two hunters (using bow and
arrows) observed what appeared to be a large dark&nbsp;figure &quot;walking
or running&quot; across a field. The unknown object traversed the region
at an 'astonishing speed.' This year, in same location, witnesses were
again at scene and heard a&nbsp;'yelping cry' after dark, that seemed to
be moving toward them. They admitted they were&nbsp;frightened and left.
They had previously sighted deer crossing same location, and noted the
differences in both size and appearance between the deer and the 'unknown
object,' which was huge and moved swiftly.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT COLOR="#00FFFF"><B>Comments: </B>Witness has assured me he will
take me to the scene where I can conduct the pending field investigation
and acquire more specific data. Other reported BIGFOOT <BR>
sightings have been acquired from independent sources within this exact
locality, dating back to 1981. An effort will also be made to contact the
second witness and acquire <BR>
&nbsp;his testimony.</FONT></P>

<LI><FONT COLOR="#00FFFF"><FONT SIZE=-1>On Friday, February 13, 1998, the
<B>Peebles, Ohio Police Department</B> <I>(937-587-3191) </I>was contacted
regarding the recent acquisition of a number of reported 'Bigfoot' sightings
in or near the Peach Mountain area of Adams County.</FONT></FONT></LI>

<P><FONT COLOR="#00FFFF"><FONT SIZE=-1>The dispatcher on duty had no knowledge
of any such reports, and even made inquiries with other policemen who were
in the office. She said all animal matters are handled through the county
sheriff's department. The dispatcher expressed fleeting interest in the
reports which I briefly described, stating that a large 'primate or bear'
had been reported by several persons near Steam Furnace Road. She said
to contact the county sheriff regarding any such reports. The area around
Davis Memorial Road is also within county jurisdiction, and not that of
Peebles, she said.</FONT></FONT></P>

<LI><FONT COLOR="#00FFFF"><FONT SIZE=-1><B>The Adams County Sheriff's Department</B>
<I>(937-544-2314)</I> was also contacted, and the female dispatcher did
not volunteer any information relevant to my concerns. She recommended
that a phone call be placed to The Adams County Game Warden.</FONT></FONT></LI>
</UL>

<UL>
<LI><FONT COLOR="#00FFFF"><FONT SIZE=-1><B>The Adams County Game Warden</B>
(<I>name and phone number on file</I>), who operates the office out of
his home, was also contacted.. He had no knowledge of the aforementioned
reports, and states that a written summation is usually filed in the event
of bear reports, of which he also had none from the Peach Mountain/Davis
Memorial Road area. He was advised of the pending field investigation,
and was asked for assistance. He agreed to assist and will provide vehicle(s)
and other equipment if necessary. He was informed that a date will be arranged
with the witnesses to establish a meeting place.</FONT></FONT></LI>

Creature Report from same area... 1985</FONT></FONT></P>

<P><FONT COLOR="#00FF00"><B>Subject:</B> Mike Walden [Name changed for
privacy purposes, on file]. Walden verbally advised co-workers of a suspected
'Bigfoot sighting.' Information reached this researcher through a mutual
acquaintance. </FONT></P>

<P><FONT COLOR="#00FF00"><B>Time of event:</B> Late October/early November,
1985. 6:30 or 7:00 p.m. </FONT></P>

<P><FONT COLOR="#00FF00"><B>Location</B>: Near Peebles, Ohio (Adams County)
near Beaver Pond, between Jaybird Road and S.R. 73. Also near the GE/Peebles
Test Operation property line. </FONT></P>

<P><FONT COLOR="#00FF00"><B>Description: </B>Human-like creature covered
with dark-brown hair observed by four motorists while traversing through
region.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT COLOR="#00FF00"><B>Comments: </B>During a telephone interview
on Wednesday, February 18, 1998, with Mike Walden (name changed to protect
witness privacy), more details were made available concerning a suspected
'Bigfoot' sighting from a locality in Adams County.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT COLOR="#00FF00">He was located through mutual contact with a fellow
employee, who this writer has spoken with in the past.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT COLOR="#00FF00">Walden collects Indian artifacts, and is interested
in Ohio Archeology. He sounded cognizant and intelligent, and is viewed
by this researcher as a highly reliable witness.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT COLOR="#00FF00">It was in late October or early November of 1985
that Walden, employed within the region, was driving a truck near Beaver
Pond, off of Jaybird Road and close to Route 73. He was on-duty with the
company he works for, and also present were three other people. Their assignment
was to 'pick up valves for fuel systems.'</FONT></P>

<P><FONT COLOR="#00FF00">The driver, Mr. Walden, glanced to his left and
observed a human-like creature around 6-feet tall that was in a hollow.
It caught his eye because it was moving, and he stopped the vehicle to
observe.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT COLOR="#00FF00">&quot;It was like some kind of human, but I didn't
know what it was,&quot; Walden stated. &quot;We didn't think it was a bear,
and we watched it for about 5 or 10 seconds before it just 'blended in'
with the surroundings.&quot;</FONT></P>

<P><FONT COLOR="#00FF00">Upon returning to the place of employment, Walden
and the others advised their fellow co-workers. &quot;We got some good
jokes out of it, but we all told them there was a Bigfoot out there,&quot;
he said.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT COLOR="#00FF00">At the time he observed the creature, Walden said
he suspected right away that it could be a 'Bigfoot.'</FONT></P>

<P><FONT COLOR="#00FF00">&quot;What else could it be?&quot; he said.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT COLOR="#00FF00">Walden said the creature had an appearance of
a human being, but was covered with dark brown hair. The creature was standing
in the brush on the edge of dense woodland, and he thinks the creature
may have been eating.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT COLOR="#00FF00">&quot;It had a form like it was standing erect.&quot;</FONT></P>

<P><FONT COLOR="#00FF00">Walden claims that the creature disappeared from
view by standing still. Upon doing so, it seemed to 'blend in' with the
surroundings.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT COLOR="#00FF00">&quot;It just quit moving and we lost track of
it. It was getting late, we couldn't see it anymore so we left,&quot; he
said.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT COLOR="#00FF00">The creature was situated on the edge of the woodland,
several hundred feet from the road, where the vehicle had been parked.
&quot;I'd say it was at least several hundred feet away to where it was,
so it was not close enough to make out any details like eyes or anything,&quot;
he added.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT COLOR="#00FF00">The sighting occurred around 6:30 or 7:00 p.m.,
just before dark. The trees were losing their leaves at the time.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT COLOR="#00FF00">Walden added that the area where the sighting
occurred is dense woodland and extremely remote. He also stated his knowledge
of other wildlife in the region, including turkeys, deer, and coyotes.
Several years ago, he said to have seen a large black panther or 'big bobcat'
in the same area after 2:00 a.m.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT COLOR="#00FF00">He also said there had been sightings of a small
black bear near Seaman Ohio on Lawshe Road. The game warden shot and killed
two of the bears, each weighing an estimated 75 lbs.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT COLOR="#00FF00">Walden stated that the creature he observed was
not a bear.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT COLOR="#00FF00">He did not know the present whereabouts of two
of the witnesses involved, and felt that the third witness would not be
inclined to speak of this experience to researchers.</FONT></P>
