UFO Crash...?</font></font></font>

<p><i><font face="ARIAL,HELVETICA"><font color="#FFFF00"><font size=-1><b>Special
Note:</b> I was advised of the following item by a spectator on Sunday,
March 16th [1997] while attending a booth at the Cincinnati Convention
Center. I had been working the table, and the stand was a UFO exhibit.
There was moderate traffic, and frequently, the wandering spectators would
stop to talk or ask questions. One particular gentleman approached and
gave me the <u>specific date and page number</u> of an article he said
'I would be interested in.'</font></font></font></i><i><font face="ARIAL,HELVETICA"><font color="#FFFF00"><font size=-1></font></font></font></i>
<p><i><font face="ARIAL,HELVETICA"><font color="#FFFF00"><font size=-1>He
said the article was regarding a crashed object which was found by a trapper.
The object, he said, had rooms, and there were hieroglyphic writings found
on it. I wrote down the date and name of the newspaper on the back of a
business card, and the man walked away.</font></font></font></i><i><font face="ARIAL,HELVETICA"><font color="#FFFF00"><font size=-1></font></font></font></i>
<p><i><font face="ARIAL,HELVETICA"><font color="#FFFF00"><font size=-1>Over
1-month had passed before I had time to get to the library, and when I
did, I kept the</font></font></font></i>
<br><i><font face="ARIAL,HELVETICA"><font color="#FFFF00"><font size=-1>business
card with the name and date of the newspaper with me as I sought to verify
his claim.</font></font></font></i>
<br><i><font face="ARIAL,HELVETICA"><font color="#FFFF00"><font size=-1>Strangely
enough, I pulled the newspaper and bingo, his account was legit. The following
is the</font></font></font></i>
<br><i><font face="ARIAL,HELVETICA"><font color="#FFFF00"><font size=-1>article
in its entirety. I have not seen nor heard from the man since, but I gave
him my business</font></font></font></i>
<br><i><font face="ARIAL,HELVETICA"><font color="#FFFF00"><font size=-1>card.
I don't know how he would have known the specific date and page number
of the article.</font></font></font></i><i><font face="ARIAL,HELVETICA"><font color="#FFFF00"><font size=-1></font></font></font></i>
<p><i><font face="ARIAL,HELVETICA"><font color="#FFFF00"><font size=-1>I
don't recall hearing of this story before, so I can't say if it has already
been researched. Has</font></font></font></i>
<br><i><font face="ARIAL,HELVETICA"><font color="#FFFF00"><font size=-1>anyone
heard of this account before? If so, please let me know. [Posted on the

<p><font face="ARIAL,HELVETICA"><font color="#FFFF00"><font size=-1>Mr.
James Lumley, an old Rocky Mountain trapper, who has been stopping at the
Everett House for several days, makes a most remarkable statement to us,
and one, which if authenticated, will produce the greatest excitement in
the scientific world.</font></font></font><font face="ARIAL,HELVETICA"><font color="#FFFF00"><font size=-1></font></font></font>
<p><font face="ARIAL,HELVETICA"><font color="#FFFF00"><font size=-1>Mr.
Lumley states that about the middle of last September, he was engaged in
trapping in the mountains, about seventy-five or one hundred miles above
the great falls of the Upper Missouri, and in the neighborhood of what
is known as Cadotte Pass. Just after sunset one evening he beheld a bright,
luminous body in the heavens, which was moving with a great rapidity in
an easterly direction. It was plainly visible for at least five seconds,
when it suddenly separated into particles, resembling, as Mr. Lumley described
it, the bursting of a skyrocket in the air. A few minutes later he heard
a heavy explosion, which jarred the earth very preceptibly, and this was
shortly after followed by a rumbling sound, like a tornado sweeping through
the forest. A strong wind sprang up about the same time, but as suddenly
subsided. The air was also filled with a peculiar odor of a sulphurous
character.</font></font></font><font face="ARIAL,HELVETICA"><font color="#FFFF00"><font size=-1></font></font></font>
<p><font face="ARIAL,HELVETICA"><font color="#FFFF00"><font size=-1>These
incidents would have made but slight impression on the mind of Mr. Lumley,
but for the fact that on the ensuing day he discovered, at a distance of
about two miles from his camping place, that, as far as he could see in
either direction, a path had been cut through the forest, several rods
wide - giant trees uprooted or broken off near the ground - the tops of
hills shaved off, and the earth plowed up in many places. Great and wide-spread
havoc was every-where visible. Following up this track of desolation, he
soon ascertained the cause of it in the shape of an immense stone that
had been driven into the side of a mountain. But now comes the most remarkable
part of the story. An</font></font></font>
<br><font face="ARIAL,HELVETICA"><font color="#FFFF00"><font size=-1>examination
of this stone, or so much of it as was visible, showed that it had been
divided into compartments, and that, in various places, it was carved with
curious hieroglyphics. More than this, Mr. Lumley also discovered fragments
of a substance resembling glass, and here and there dark stains, as though
caused by a liquid. He is confident that the hieroglyphics were the work
of human hands, and that the stone itself, although but a fragment of an
immense body, must have been used for some purpose by animated beings.</font></font></font><font face="ARIAL,HELVETICA"><font color="#FFFF00"><font size=-1></font></font></font>
<p><font face="ARIAL,HELVETICA"><font color="#FFFF00"><font size=-1>Strange
as this story appears, Mr. Lumley relates it with so much sincerity that
we are forced to accept it as true. It was evident that the stone which
he discovered was a fragment of the meteor which was visible in this section
in September last. It will be remembered that it was seen in Leavenworth,
in Galena, and in this city by Colonel Bonneville. At Leavenworth, it was
seen to separate in particles or explode.</font></font></font>
