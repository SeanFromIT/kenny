BLACK FALLS, Wis., July 11 (U.P.) - Electrician Sig Hanson said today he
had found a plastic "flying saucer" shaped like two soup bowls fastened
together and containing a radio tube which he thought might have provided
the gadget with flight power.
<p>Hanson said he found the gadget which had two small propeller blades
on the Jackson County fairgrounds.
<p>He said it contained a motor about the size of a man's fist and a four-inch
shaft leading from the motor.
<p>Wisconsin civil air patrol officials and Maj. John Schindler, army air
forces liason officer to the CAP, said they would investigate the "disc."

<p><b><font face="Arial Narrow"><font size=+1>At 1:20 p.m. July 11, 1947,
this office was called by the man in charge of the Civil Air Patrol of
Wisconsin, an auxiliary of the Army Air Forces.&nbsp; Calling from Black
River Falls, Wisconsin, he "telephonically advised this office that an
object in the shape of a disc, nineteen inches in diameter had been found
on July 10, 1947, by one SCORE-OUT city electrician on the Jackson County
fairgrounds, near Black River Falls, Ws, about 3:30 p.m.&nbsp; The disc
might be made of a substance such as cardboard covered by a silver airplane
dope material.&nbsp; The contraption has a small wooden tail like a rudder
in the back and inside of the disc is what appears to be an RCA photo-electric
cell or tube.&nbsp; Also inside the disc is a little electric motor with
a shaft running to the center of the disc.&nbsp; At one end of the shaft
is a very small propeller.&nbsp; In SCORE-OUT opinion the contraption might
possibly have been made by some juvenile.&nbsp; SCORE-OUT stated that he
desired to return the contraption to Milwaukee and eventually turn it over
to the Army Air Forces, but that the finder, SCORE-OUT, apparently wanted
to get some publicity on his find and wanted it returned to him."</font></font></b>
