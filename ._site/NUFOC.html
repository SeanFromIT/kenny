I can make a few observations, beingthe conference coordinator, concerning my perception of the event and itsoutcome as per our expectancy going in, and that will obviously be differentthan one who was simply attending the conference.</font></b><p><b><font color="#60CA8E">From my perception of conference organizer,I think we had absolute tons of publicity for the conference for months,weeks, days and hours leading up to the event, but although our turnoutdid not reach the targeted '300 people' we were optimistically hoping for,we had a fair turnout of about 150 people. At least it was a 'break even'event but considering the time, effort and anticipation involved in itsorganization, it would have been nice to come out ahead a little more.There were a few no-shows who said they would be there. I attribute theless than robust turnout to a tough ideological climate in the conservativeCincinnati tri-state, compounded by a general complacency and lack of interestand curiosity in the UFO subject.</font></b><p><b><font color="#60CA8E">On the other hand, the conference itself wasfun. Don Weatherby and Wendy Ban really saved the day in many ways, andtheir efforts are really appreciated. There was a large contingent of newsmedia reporters and camera crew roaming about throughout the day as JohnTimmerman gave a well-received presentation and photographic slide-show(I hope he plans to do many more) and Rick Hilberg also delivered a goodhistorical presentation of "UFO's, The First 30 Years." Terry Endres hadan informative Power Point presentation concerning astronomical sciencesand the ET hypothesis, but the real big hit of the afternoon session wasJerry Black, who eventually won the ideologically resistant crowd overwith his powerhouse 'Credibility In UFOlogy' lecture, in which he exposedthe fraudulence of MUFON's handling of the Gulf Breeze disaster and addressedthe many serious issues concerning the current bag of national UFO investigators.He really caused a fuss. I wouldn't have believed it if I hadn't seen it,but the cantankerous Jerry Black drew a non-stop crowd at his table allday long and for the rest of the night.</font></b><p><b><font color="#60CA8E">The evening session began with author and SaucerSmear editor Jim Moseley, a gritty old timer with a 'tude and also a realfun character to be around. There were many good comments about his lecture.Texas researcher Derrel Sims continued with an interesting presentationcalled "Advanced Alien Technology," the content of which was said to havecaused some conference-goers frightful discomfort, and the real highlightof the conference was the funny, articulate and very intelligent StephenBassett who closed out the evening with a firmly held crowd listening attentivelyto his informative lecture called "The Politics of Disclosure." Severalpeople that I talked with said it was one of the best speeches they haveever heard. I did catch a little of it and can tell you first-hand thatStephen Bassett is an absolutely tremendous speaker, and I would very muchwant to hear him again.</font></b><p><b><font color="#60CA8E">It was Donnie Blessing who worked extremelyhard for the conference, putting in many hours of effort and organizationalplanning. She also thankfully undertook a good brunt of the media activitywhich will even be continuing into this week, from my understanding. Manythanks to Donnie and her husband Bobby, plus a special thanks to ChrisCoffey, Danny Russell,&nbsp; Bruce M. Forrester Jr., Lance Moody, EarleBenezet, Jeff Sindiong Video Productions, Bob Leibold and Natural LightProductions, Carol Bieber, Gerald Jones and Dr. Gregory Tyree, Ph.D. andall the others for their hard volunteer work in putting this together.And I thank everyone for coming to the conference and hope they had a goodtime, learned something and took home a memorable experience. I certainlydid.</font></b><p><b><font color="#60CA8E">KENNY YOUNG</font></b><br><hr WIDTH="100%"><p><b><i><font color="#FFFFFF">The 39th Annual National UFO Conference</font></i></b><br><b><i><font color="#FFFFFF">Kings Island Resort &amp; Conference Center</font></i></b><p><b><i><font color="#FFFFFF">Opening Statement</font></i></b><br><b><i><font color="#FFFFFF">by Kenny Young</font></i></b><p><b><i><font color="#FFFFFF">REBIRTH OF CURIOSITY</font></i></b><p><b><font color="#FFFFFF">Let us assume that our small planet earth andall its human inhabitants were under surveillance by an advanced extraterrestrialintelligence. In the same way that various countries on earth spy on eachother for their own security purposes, let us theorize that this advancedintelligence also keeps close watch of earth and its primitive inhabitants,sort of like keeping a close eye on the trashy neighbors in the interstellarneighborhood.</font></b><p><b><font color="#FFFFFF">Perhaps such an advanced intelligence mightdo more than simply maintain a 'hands off' covert reconnaissance of ourworld; what if such an advanced intelligence might even interact with oursocieties, cultures and traditions from time to time to help stabilizeour society. In this same hypothetical musing, let us also theorize thatthis advanced intelligence occasionally provides our primitive civilizationwith some guidance from time to time, hopeful that the interstellar trashcalled humanity may be recycled into something better.</font></b><p><b><font color="#FFFFFF">But what shape would this guidance take? Howmight such guidance be tender to our numerous sensibilities, yet instructiveto our needs? Perhaps the best form of guidance would be the tool calledCURIOSITY.</font></b><p><b><font color="#FFFFFF">On September 11, 2001, Muslim hijackers murderedthousands of unsuspecting Americans. These religious individuals were enrapturedwith the belief that their murderous acts would be rewarded by a divinebeing, eternal life and numerous virgins. CERTAINTY was the motivatingfactor behind their actions, certainty in their faith. History is fullof wars, killing and atrocities caused by certainty and belief. Perhapsif the Muslim hijackers were better educated in the wonders of scienceand its many mysteries, things may have been different on 9-1-1. Perhapsif they were curious about other cultures and beliefs, their world viewwould be tempered with more patience and tolerance. Perhaps if there wasa shred of curiosity regarding the absolutism of their own convictions,things would be different.</font></b><p><b><font color="#FFFFFF">There should be no doubt that certainty isthe kryptonite of humanity. In ages past, certainty, couple forevermorewith ignorance, was best left alone to spark localized mass killings andregional wars. But in our present day of nuclear nations, terrorist organizations,rogue groups and individuals constantly seeking weapons of mass destructionat an uncontrollable rate, the scourge of certainty becomes more threateningby the moment.</font></b><p><b><font color="#FFFFFF">The only force that may hinder certainty maybe curiosity. But curiosity has been driven back by the ideological. Curiosityis discouraged by defenders of faith or bad science, those having a skewedagenda, those who use twisted reasoning to misinform. Complacency results,disinterest runs rampant and such higher issues are trivialized by a societybound up in its own ignorance.</font></b><p><b><font color="#FFFFFF">What has happened to curiosity?</font></b><p><b><font color="#FFFFFF">Consider for a moment, an interesting eventthat happened 50-years to the day of still unexplained 1952 UFO overflightsof our nation's capitol that made banner headlines across the country.This summer, on July 26, 2002, an unidentified radar target was trackedby NORAD, approaching the restricted airspace around Washington D.C. Twofully-armed F-16 fighter jets were scrambled to intercept the intruder,but the pilots reportedly saw nothing and returned happily to base. Despitethe happy ending as per officialdom, all hell tore loose in nearby Waldorf,Maryland as citizens reported a fiery blue light doggedly chased by militaryfighter jets.</font></b><p><b><font color="#FFFFFF">Curiosity knocks.</font></b><p><b><font color="#FFFFFF">Think about it: at a sensitive time of terroristconcerns nationwide, an unidentified low-flying object approaches the nation'scapital, refuses to identify itself and somehow outsmarts or out-maneuversour top of the line pilots and fighter jet interceptors. Curiosity knocksbut the door remains shut as there is little media interest in the event,no investigative journalism, no follow up. There is no media demand fora press conference to hear about temperature inversions, funny lights orwitness misperception. Actually, aside from FOX News and small articlein The Washington Post, the news media finds greater comfort in exploringthe escapades of Martha Stewart and the behind-the-scenes bickering ofbaseball strike negotiators.</font></b><p><b><font color="#FFFFFF">Curiosity is left out in the cold.</font></b><p><b><font color="#FFFFFF">If this hypothetical advanced intelligencediscussed earlier were really out there somewhere, guiding us by the overtinteraction resulting from a UFO sighting, we must be collectively wiseenough to rise to the occasion, brush of the complacency and comfort ofideology and recognize these higher scientific issues and unresolved mysteries.</font></b><p><b><font color="#FFFFFF">That seed of curiosity just may complicatethe kryptonite of certainty and hopefully stabilize a society that is spiralingtoward self destruction.</font></b><p><b><font color="#FFFFFF">Curiosity, governed by pure, unadulterated,unrestricted and uninhibited skepticism, may be our only hope for survival.</font></b><p><b><font color="#FFFFFF">Perhaps today, something that you may hearat this 39th Annual National UFO Conference may trigger that healthy senseof curiosity. And with this primary objective, we have a fine lineup ofresearchers and speakers who have committed themselves to personal investigationof our greatest present-day mystery, and they are prepared to report findingsand information that will hopefully compound certainty, obfuscate complacencyand give rise to curiosity. We welcome you to the conference and inviteyou to consider, with an open mind, the information presented here today.</font></b><br>&nbsp;</body></html>
