The caller lefta phone number that did not work as I tried to redial. The call soundedcredible, and the man said he had received the information from a Ham radiooperator.</font><p><font color="#FFFFFF">I then called the Miami University Police Dispatchoffice at 513-529-2222 with hopes of getting more information. When thedispatcher answered the phone, I point-blank asked: "what had happenedover the airport tonight?" at which point the dispatcher said: "Oh, I thinkthat was a helicopter."</font><p><font color="#FFFFFF">Intrigued, I then went on to ask for some detailsabout the event. He said that the Oxford police department took the firstreports from people who thought they saw a UFO. He said the airport isunmanned and there is no radar or air traffic control tower at the airport,which is a fairly small runway. He felt that the object was identifiedas a helicopter by a police officer. He then recommended that I call theOxford police department.</font><p><font color="#FFFFFF">I then called the Oxford Police Department at513-524-5240 and an Officer Blevins said that their department had beenadvised of the event by the Butler County Sheriff's department. Citizencalls reporting a UFO were received by the Butler County dispatch before10:00 p.m. on Friday evening. While the Oxford police dispatcher was unawareof any sighting over the Oxford airport, she did advise of an object thatwas seen to the west, over the city of Franklin. She said that a Franklinpolice officer had identified the object as a helicopter.</font><p><font color="#FFFFFF">A third phone call was placed to the Butler CountySheriff Department at 513-785-1300. The dispatcher handling the call, OfficerMetzger, was not fully aware of the event but said it had been explainedas "Possibly a star cluster." Coming on for the 3rd shift duty, she wasnot aware of the witness descriptions or the nature of the calls.</font><p><font color="#FFFFFF">The Franklin police department was contacted at937-746-2882 and the dispatcher taking the call was surprised when I hadasked about UFO sightings in the area and she said: "not through our policedepartment." The call was then handled by a second officer at the FranklinCity Police Department who also knew nothing of any such reports. I informedthat Butler County had said calls began around 10:00 p.m. and that theobject was seen over Franklin. The officer said she knew nothing of sucha report. I also said the suspected object was possibly identified as ahelicopter by a Franklin officer and she said that there was no Franklinofficer involved in any such sighting, further saying that she had beenon duty all night and 'would have known about it.'</font><p><font color="#FFFFFF">I then called the Warren County police dispatchheadquarters at 513-420-4289 and the officer taking the call, identifyinghimself as Jason, said that he had not heard of any UFO sighting reportsand their office had not taken any incoming calls of such.</font><p><font color="#FFFFFF">Another phone call was placed to the Miamisburghpolice headquarters at 937-866-3344, and they also were unaware of anyUFO sighting reports.</font><p><b><font color="#FFFFFF">COMMENT</font></b><p><font color="#FFFFFF">Four separate sources advise of reported UFO activitynear Oxford, Ohio : 1) an informant leaving a telephone message whose returnphone number does not work, 2). The Miami University Police Dispatch Officeconfirms reports of suspected UFO seen near airport and adds that it wasidentified as 'helicopter' and 3) Oxford Police Department confirms ofnotification by Butler County Dispatch due to citizen complaints of UFOseen over Franklin and 4) Butler County confirms citizen complaints ofUFO sighting around 10:00 p.m. but suggests the reports are due to a 'starcluster.'</font><p><font color="#FFFFFF">This is a most curious episode. Exact detailsof what was reported are still not available. Conflicting information ispresent in that officers at Miami University police dispatch presumed that"an" object was explained as a helicopter by a Franklin police officerwhile neither the Franklin police department nor the Butler County or WarrenCounty sheriff headquarters can shed any light on 1). reports of a UFO,2). helicopter identification claim or 3) Franklin police officer.</font><p><font color="#FFFFFF">More puzzling is that Oxford police headquartersdirectly advised that a UFO was reported over the city of Franklin whileFranklin police officers deny any knowledge of such reports.</font><p><font color="#FFFFFF">This general area is around 25-miles southwestof Wright Patterson Air Force Base.</font><p><font color="#FFFFFF">Filed;</font><br><font color="#FFFFFF">August 10, 2002</font><br><font color="#FFFFFF">KENNY YOUNG</font><br><font color="#FFFFFF">--</font><br><font color="#FFFFFF">UFO Research</font><br><font color="#FFFFFF"><a href="https://home.fuse.net/ufo">https://home.fuse.net/ufo</a></font></td></tr></table></center><center><b><font color="#FFEA18"><a href="mailto:anomalyresponse@gmail.com">E-mail questionsor comments</a>&nbsp; |&nbsp; <a href="https://home.fuse.net/ufo">Returnto MAIN PAGE</a></font></b><br><b><font color="#FFEA18"><font size=-1>Website designed by Kenny Young|&nbsp; &copy;2003 All Rights Reserved</font></font></b><br><b><i><font color="#FFEA18"><font size=-1>This page created on March2, 2003</font></font></i></b></center></body></html>
