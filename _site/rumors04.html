The situation complicates, however, as others begin describing unusual contrails, jet scrambles andother military activity all across northern Ohio. One caller, Amin, describes an unusual light seen the night before Sept. 22 while driving home fromDetroit around 1:00 a.m. while another caller, Kevin, claims the similar sighting of a 'bluish green light' around 10:35 p.m. on Route 8 near theStow, Ohio area (north of Akron). At daybreak the morning of Sept. 22, northeastern Ohio skies were allegedly 'ripped' with jet vapor trails.</font></b><b><font face="Arial,Helvetica"></font></b><p><b><font face="Arial,Helvetica">One caller, Don, is a truck driver with a route between Cleveland and Youngstown, and alleges that his GPS (Global Positioning System) that pinpoints his mapping location on a laptop computer, began malfunctioning between 8 and 9:00 a.m., although working flawlesslybeforehand. Stranger still, another caller named Dave claimed that Route 12, a south/north road out of Fostoria, Ohio, was blocked by "tons" ofarmy trucks and traffic was being diverted.</font></b><b><font face="Arial,Helvetica"></font></b><p><b><font face="Arial,Helvetica">This activity was briefly referenced on the Cleveland UFO E-list by George Pindroh, but with no new</font></b><br><b><font face="Arial,Helvetica">information. Secondly, I did receive three E-mail advisement's regarding this activity from various contacts,along with one copied message from 'June' that states: </font></b><i><font face="Arial,Helvetica">"I talked with my Mom today, and she told me that on channel 19 at 5 pm, Wed., Sept. 22, the TV news anchor said that there were hundreds of reportsof UFO's all over the lakefront area of Ohio. He said that after the commercial breaks he would give the details. My mom was very curious and waited tohear the news. When the news came back on, NOTHING. So the story was squashed.I talked to a few people at work today, and yes, they had heard about the sightings. Everyone was talking about it. So lots of people here in Ohioheard about it before the news was suppressed. According to my Mom, the TV anchor said that people saw what looked like a huge cloud with rainbowcolors along with many UFO's that were not disguising themselves as clouds.I also learned that fighter jets were sent out after them."</font></i><b><font face="Arial,Helvetica">(Note, I do not know June who copied me on her comments to a few other researchers, but she signed her name with the addition of "In The Light,"and I cannot vouch for her comments -- KY)</font></b><b><font face="Arial,Helvetica"></font></b><p><b><font face="Arial,Helvetica">Thirdly, a comment about the WTAM radio activity was filed to the National UFO Reporting Center (N.U.F.O.R.C.)website, but also containing no new information.</font></b><b><font face="Arial,Helvetica"></font></b><p><b><font face="Arial,Helvetica">Further, Mrs. Donnie Blessing, Southern Ohio State Director for MUFON (Mutual UFO Network) spoke with a gentlemanfrom Cleveland named Ken who contacted the Cincinnati UFO Hotline (513 - 588 - 4548) on September 28th to advise of a UFO sighting in Canada onSeptember 21st. While taking the information, Ken advised that his wife knew of the strange reports on WTAM radio station on September 22, andfurther informed of UFOs and numerous (presumably) responding military helicopters seen near the Perry Nuclear Power Station. This specific detailhas been considered most intriguing. At this time, we know of no substantive information to link this reference of a UFO situation near the Perry NuclearPower Station to the September 22nd activity reported by WTAM radio.</font></b><b><font face="Arial,Helvetica"></font></b><p><b><font face="Arial,Helvetica">Oddly, there was previous UFO activity reported 'on the record' by a Lake County law officer referenced in conjunctionwith the Perry Nuclear Facility in June of 2004, that report is located online at: <a href="https://kenny.anomalyresponse.com/willoughby04.html">https://kenny.anomalyresponse.com/willoughby04.html</a></font></b><b><font face="Arial,Helvetica"></font></b><p><b><font face="Arial,Helvetica">So unusual was this September 22nd activity that radio station WTAM created a special web page for the</font></b><br><b><font face="Arial,Helvetica">situation.

He played the phone calls from that morning and mentioned his observations on his #1 rated afternoon show that day and asked the question "What the heck is going on"</font></font></i></b><br><b><i><font face="Arial,Helvetica"><font color="#71985E"> </font></font></i></b><br><b><i><font face="Arial,Helvetica"><font color="#71985E">The callers responded.Below are some of the calls that were made to the show on the 22nd.
