When askedhow she knew this, she said that it was mentioned at church one morning,and others said 'they've heard about it.'&nbsp;</font></b><b><font face="Arial,Helvetica"></font></b><p><b><font face="Arial,Helvetica">Her description is as follows: The objectis a big, bright light that hovers in one spot, and sometimes 'darts around.'There is no noise. The object is not really close to her vantage point,and she characterizes its proximity to her viewing location as 'being juston the other side of the hill.' It has been seen in an area behind herhouse. She said that the object would 'first look like a plane if you justlooked at it,' but that it would sometimes hover in the same spot for morethan 1-hour.&nbsp;</font></b><b><font face="Arial,Helvetica"></font></b><p><b><font face="Arial,Helvetica">The object is seen in the east/south-east,and moves toward the south. The witness said that she can recognize stars,and added 'stars don't move and dart around.'&nbsp;</font></b><b><font face="Arial,Helvetica"></font></b><p><b><font face="Arial,Helvetica">The location of Foster, Kentucky isbetween Route 8 and Route 9 (AA Highway), 35-miles East of Cincinnati,halfway between Alexandria and Maysville, Kentucky.&nbsp;</font></b><b><font face="Arial,Helvetica"></font></b><p><b><font face="Arial,Helvetica">INVESTIGATION</font></b><b><font face="Arial,Helvetica"></font></b><p><b><font face="Arial,Helvetica">Two phone calls were placed to The BRACKENCOUNTY SHERIFF'S DEPARTMENT 1-606-735-3233 concerning this investigation.The first phone receptionist had not heard of any UFO reports or stories.He suggested I call the Chief Dispatcher Marie England at 1-606-735-2700.England was very cooperative and said that there were no reports that shewas aware of, and briefly expressed interest in the sighting, asking thelocation where reported. She verbally checked with another officer, alsoin the same room, and that person had no knowledge of anything reportedeither. She said that she reviews logs everyday, and any such reports wouldbe known either by log or word of mouth.&nbsp;</font></b><b><font face="Arial,Helvetica"></font></b><p><b><font face="Arial,Helvetica">COMMENT&nbsp;</font></b><b><font face="Arial,Helvetica"></font></b><p><b><font face="Arial,Helvetica">On the basis of the initial report,my first reaction is 'VENUS' or 'SATURN.' To review UFO sightings objectively,it is necessary to keep open the possibility of eyewitness misperception.Unless other witnesses come forward or specific video or photographic materialis offered, there is no way to evaluate the singular claim of the witnessand the account cannot be held as certain.</font></b><b><font face="Arial,Helvetica"></font></b><p><b><font face="Arial,Helvetica">FILED<br>October 2, 1997&nbsp;</font></b><br><b><font face="Arial,Helvetica">Kenny Young</font></b></blockquote><center><p><br><hr WIDTH="100%"><br><b><font face="Arial,Helvetica">UFO RESEARCH</font></b><br><b><font face="Arial,Helvetica"><a href="https://home.fuse.net/ufo">Returnto MAIN PAGE</a> |&nbsp; <a href="mailto:anomalyresponse@gmail.com">E-mail Questionsor Comments</a></font></b></center></td></tr></table></center><br>&nbsp;<br>&nbsp;</body></html>
