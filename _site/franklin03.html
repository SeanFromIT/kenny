Upon observing the lights, she drove inpursuit of them at the urging of her son. She drove around the area forabout 1-mile and did observe the situation for an estimated 2 to 3-minuteduration of time.</b><b></b><p><b>The big green lights, she said, numbered from two or more and wouldcomprise patterns ranging from a big circle to a rectangle. The left andright lights would, according to the witness, 'move to the center' andthen back again, and was comparable in size to a full moon from her perspective.She was uncertain if each light was an individual object or if the lightswere part of a larger single object, flashing in sequence.</b><b></b><p><b>"There was a pattern to the way the lights would flash," the witnessreports, "they would move in uniform formation at the same time and stayat an equal distance to one another."</b><b></b><p><b>Sandy said the lights, which appeared over an area near Springboro,Ohio on Route 741, moved from south to north and eventually vanished overthe treetops.</b><b></b><p><b>"When we got home, my kids urged me to call Wright Patterson AirForce Base," she said. "So I called them, thinking it would be better thancalling the Springboro police. They just referred me to you."</b><b></b><p><b>Sandy informs that her husband is skeptical of her sighting, sayingthat the lights were probably advertising skylights.</b><b></b><p><b>"I don't think these were any sort of skylights," she said. "Thelights were brilliant green, not fuzzy, and there were no beams."</b><b></b><p><b>Sandy said that the sky conditions at the time of the sighting werepartly cloudy.</b><b></b><p><b>COMMENT</b><b></b><p><b>One cannot rule out that advertising searchlights may account forthis sighting report, but it is also interesting to note that there hasbeen a significant rise in UFO sighting reports from the southern Ohiovicinity in late August and September of 2003. A spate of UFO sightingsfrom Proctorville and Rome Township, Ohio have been attributed to advertisingsearchlights by local news media searching for answers, but not withoutdebate from eyewitnesses.</b><br><b>&nbsp;</b><b></b><p><b>This Franklin, Ohio location is an estimated 27.5 miles southwestof Wright Patterson Air Force Base in Dayton, Ohio (Montgomery County).</b><b></b><p><b>Filed;</b><b></b><p><b>September 29, 2003</b><br><b>KENNY YOUNG</b><br><b>--</b><br><b>UFO Research</b><br><b>https://home.fuse.net/ufo</b><br><hr WIDTH="100%"><b><font size=+2><a href="https://home.fuse.net/ufo"></a></font></b><center><p><b><font size=+2><a href="https://home.fuse.net/ufo">RETURN TO MAIN PAGE<br>UFO RESEARCH</a></font></b></center></body></html>
