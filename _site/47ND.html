Woodworth, N.D. (U.P.) � A �flying saucer� found here this morning turned
out to be a hoax.
<p>Five Woodworth men admitted shortly after noon today that they built
the �saucer� Thursday night and �planted� it on the Bert Miller lawn, where
it was discovered this morning.
<p>�We just wanted to see what would happen,� Oscar Cellmer, one of the
five saucer builders, said.
<p>What happened was that the story about the saucer eventually found its
way as far as Washington, D.C., and the army was reported to have called
Woodworth. That call came a few moments after the pranksters admitted the
hoax.
<p>Hundreds of visitors flocked to Woodworth this morning, afoot, by car
and plane.
<p>Cellmer, William Clark, John Wingire, Palmer Hanson and Lester Thompson,
all residents of Woodworth, admitted, amid laughter, that they worked until
midnight Thursday night to manufacture their idea of a flying saucer.
<p>They said they built the saucer from the bottom of a wash tub, a lamp
shade, some tubes and wiring from weather observing equipment, some strands
of human hair, and miscellaneous electrical equipment. The �propeller�
turned out to be fan blades of an automobile heater.
<p>The miscellaneous equipment was cleverly assembled, Deputy Sheriff Don
Johnson reported after inspecting the saucer, and cloaked under a thick
coating of silver paint.
