The initial report thatcame to my attention was submitted to Peter Davenport of The National UFOReporting Center, Seattle, Washington, and states:</font></b><b><font face="Arial,Helvetica"></font></b><p><b><font face="Arial,Helvetica">"Morehead-Rowan Co. Rescue Sq.had acall from MPD of a female crying for help x3. From 2 witness then therewas a bright light in the sky for about 1 min. RESCUE SQ.arrived on sceneand started searching the area 1st &amp; 2nd witness reported seeing this.The fire dept. was asked to begin searching with the thermal imaging camerawith no results found. Res. of Morehead was one of the witnesses. Unlessthere is a confirmed report of a missing person, the search will not becontinued."</font></b><b><font face="Arial,Helvetica"></font></b><p><b><font face="Arial,Helvetica">After reviewing this report, I placeda call to your department and was told the search and rescue event tookplace on Sunday, November 23 and that the �bright light� reported had been�the northern lights.�&nbsp;</font></b><b><font face="Arial,Helvetica"></font></b><p><b><font face="Arial,Helvetica">I decided to pursue this situation alittle further and located, via �reverse lookup� on the internet, arearesidents closest to the incident. I called one gentleman on Adams Lanewho thought the event took place on Friday, November 21. Further, he confirmedthat an unusual object was spotted in the time frame of screaming soundsand the search and rescue operation. My report of the interview with thewitness is enclosed for your consideration.</font></b><b><font face="Arial,Helvetica"></font></b><p><b><font face="Arial,Helvetica">I am hoping to further inquire aboutthis mysterious situation and determine how many folks had heard the �screamingsounds� and if any others had spotted the strange object in the sky.</font></b><b><font face="Arial,Helvetica"></font></b><p><b><font face="Arial,Helvetica">One officer at the department offeredspeculation that this situation involved the �northern lights,� but aftermy inquiries with the primary witness, a well educated college professor,this explanation is clearly not valid.</font></b><b><font face="Arial,Helvetica"></font></b><p><b><font face="Arial,Helvetica">Could you assist by confirming for methat the event (UFO sighting, screaming report or search and rescue operation)took place on November 23 or 21, or both days? Also, I request releaseof all 9-1-1 or other police tapes relevant to this incident, to includeall channels on a multi-track recording unit containing incoming citizencomplaints as well as land-based and radio correspondence and traffic.I understand this information, being �public record,� is completely releasableand appreciate your help in this situation, and can furnish a cassettetape if so desired. Also, I request release of any written report(s) onthe search and rescue, initial complaint of screaming or sighting of anUnidentified Flying Object.</font></b><b><font face="Arial,Helvetica"></font></b><p><b><font face="Arial,Helvetica">Feel free to contact me if I could answerany of your questions.
