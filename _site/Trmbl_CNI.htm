<P><FONT COLOR="#FFFF00"><FONT SIZE=+1>INCREDIBLE ALL-NIGHT POLICE CHASE
OF UFOs IN OHIO</FONT><FONT SIZE=-1> <BR>
Case Covered Up Since 1994; Discovered by Accident</FONT></FONT> </P>

<P><FONT COLOR="#FFFF00"><FONT SIZE=-1>By Michael Lindemann<BR>
CNI News</FONT></FONT></P>

<P><FONT COLOR="#FFFF00"><FONT SIZE=-1>It might never have been discovered
except for a misplaced phone call. More than two years ago, Cincinnati-based
UFO investigator Kenny Young called directory assistance for the number
of the Liberty Police Department. He thought he was calling a small town
in western Ohio, not far from Urbana. Instead, he found himself talking
to the Liberty Township PD in northeastern Ohio, just north of Youngstown.</FONT></FONT></P>

<P><FONT COLOR="#FFFF00"><FONT SIZE=-1>Not realizing the error, he asked
about a UFO case the department might have dealt with some time back. &quot;Yes
sir, I believe that was two years ago,&quot; said the friendly dispatcher,
who then began recollecting events that occurred in late 1994.</FONT></FONT></P>

<P><FONT COLOR="#FFFF00"><FONT SIZE=-1>At first, Young didn't realize that
this was a completely new case; but soon that became clear. It was new
-- and it was very, very big.</FONT></FONT></P>

<P><FONT COLOR="#FFFF00"><FONT SIZE=-1>What he now calls the Trumbull County
Disturbance involved police officers from ten or more local departments
around the Youngstown-Warren area of northeastern Ohio, chasing at least
two UFOs during a period of more than six hours in the early morning of
December 14, 1994. After more than two years of investigation, Young has
acquired an audio recording from the Liberty Township 911 Central Dispatch
Office that graphically details the amazing radio chatter accompanying
the officers' sighting and pursuit of the UFOs. Thanks to Young's generosity,
CNI News has also acquired a copy of this remarkable tape.</FONT></FONT></P>

<P><FONT COLOR="#FFFF00"><FONT SIZE=-1>Following his accidental discovery
of the incident in 1996, Young began locating and interviewing eyewitness
participants. One police officer, Tobe Melero, said he saw the UFO up close.
It appeared as a huge red light, turning the immediate area almost as bright
as day (the time was around midnight); and it disrupted the electrical
system of his car. Melero was shocked. Following his encounter, he told
the 911 dispatcher that he had to go off air for a few minutes to &quot;collect
his thoughts.&quot;</FONT></FONT></P>

<P><FONT COLOR="#FFFF00"><FONT SIZE=-1>Young knew there was more to the
case, but his investigation stalled because he was unable to pinpoint the
exact date of the incident. He was told he was being stonewalled.</FONT></FONT></P>

<P><FONT COLOR="#FFFF00"><FONT SIZE=-1>&quot;They are stonewalling you,
because they don't want you requesting the audio copies of those dispatch
tapes,&quot; one officer told him in 1996. &quot;On those tapes, it'll
tell you who all was involved in this, which implicates just about everyone.&quot;</FONT></FONT></P>

<P><FONT COLOR="#FFFF00"><FONT SIZE=-1>It was another lucky break that
finally got Young the 911 tape. Someone inside the dispatch office made
a private inquiry, first finding out the exact date, then seeking the tapes.
That person learned that the original tapes for December 14, 1994, the
night of the incident, were missing. But he managed to find a backup copy,
from which he made a copy for Young.</FONT></FONT></P>

<P><FONT COLOR="#FFFF00"><FONT SIZE=-1>As Young later discovered, officer
Tobe Melero was only one of many police officers who saw and pursued two
or more UFOs that night. Young writes: &quot;Many police departments, including
the Liberty Township Department, Howland, Hubbard and Girard City Police
Departments, as well as the Trumbull County Sheriffs Department, engaged
in an intense, late-night vehicular pursuit of a 'red, saucer shaped object'...
described by multiple police officials as an enormous, brightly luminescent
object that rotated, as if on an axis. The object allegedly made no sound,
and hovered directly above housetops in a residential neighborhood at a
disturbingly low elevation.&quot;</FONT></FONT></P>

<P><FONT COLOR="#FFFF00"><FONT SIZE=-1>Later in the chase it became apparent
that at least two objects were being observed by officers in different
locales. On the 911 audiotape, one officer (Unit 2223) reports, &quot;I've
got a visual on both of them, I'm sure you know what I'm talking about...
OK, I've got them both. I've got Howland saying it looks like it's in the
area of Warren Road, Liberty says it's down near Hubbard.&quot;</FONT></FONT></P>

<P><FONT COLOR="#FFFF00"><FONT SIZE=-1>One of the UFOs was also witnessed
by an Air Force base security guard in the company of a police officer.
The Youngstown Air Force Base is adjacent to Youngstown-Warren Regional
Municipal Airport, both in the vicinity of Vienna, east of Warren -- directly
in the center of that night's UFO activity. However, personnel in the FAA
Air Traffic Control Tower at the airport repeatedly told the 911 police
dispatcher that they could not see anything visually or on radar.</FONT></FONT></P>

<P><FONT COLOR="#FFFF00"><FONT SIZE=-1>Young was told by a &quot;tattler&quot;
inside the local FAA office that all the tower personnel involved that
night were &quot;fired&quot; or &quot;reassigned&quot; following the incident.</FONT></FONT></P>

<P><FONT COLOR="#FFFF00"><FONT SIZE=-1>Understandably, most of the numerous
police officers were not eager to come forward at first. But strangely,
a reporter for WYTV Youngstown channel 33 news, who got wind of the story
as it was breaking, chose to report nothing about it at all. To this day,
despite massive eyewitness testimony and the sensational 911 audiotape,
no mainstream news media have reported on this case.</FONT></FONT></P>

<P><FONT COLOR="#FFFF00"><FONT SIZE=-1>The incident began in the late evening
of December 13 when several citizens in the Liberty Township area called
911 to report a low flying UFO. At first, the 911 dispatcher took the reports
very lightly, making typical disdainful UFO jokes with patrol officers
over the radio. After four different people called 911 reporting UFOs,
the dispatcher became slightly more serious. Officers agreed to check out
reports of several sightings along Samson Drive.</FONT></FONT></P>

<P><FONT COLOR="#FFFF00"><FONT SIZE=-1>At about 12:30 am, reporter Stacey
Adger of WYTV news called the 911 dispatcher, saying a woman had called
the TV station to report a UFO. From this moment on, Adger was aware of
a developing story -- but she never reported it.</FONT></FONT></P>

<P><FONT COLOR="#FFFF00"><FONT SIZE=-1>More calls were received from local
citizens; soon the total was at least eight. Then, Officer Tobe Melero,
unit 998, radioed that he saw the object, a bright red glow &quot;bright
as daylight on the ground.&quot; Soon after, Unit 429 radioed that he had
the object in his binoculars. The time was approximately 1 am.</FONT></FONT></P>

<P><FONT COLOR="#FFFF00"><FONT SIZE=-1>Before the night ended, patrol officers
from ten or more surrounding jurisdictions participated in a complex cat
and mouse pursuit. Often, the UFOs -- two at least -- were said to be no
more than 50 feet off the ground. Several officers described structure.
Colors on the objects ranged from brilliant red to white to lavender, blue
and green. Often the objects hovered, but sometimes they moved much faster
than the police cars could pursue.</FONT></FONT></P>

<P><FONT COLOR="#FFFF00"><FONT SIZE=-1>The following portion of transcript
from the 911 tape, prepared by Kenny Young, demonstrates the intensity
of events that night:</FONT></FONT></P>

<UL>
<P><FONT COLOR="#FFFF00"><FONT SIZE=-1>Unknown Unit: I've got a visual
on it. I'm east on Old 82 with a visual on it by the 'S' curve. I can see
a large red, blue and green light. I am going east on Liberty. This thing's
going so fast, there's no way I can keep up with it. When I pulled in Liberty
I could see it in the distance, but I got closer and it started moving.</FONT></FONT></P>

<P><FONT COLOR="#FFFF00"><FONT SIZE=-1>Voice: Which Liberty?</FONT></FONT></P>

<P><FONT COLOR="#FFFF00"><FONT SIZE=-1>Unknown Unit: Liberty off of Belmont.
I don't see it now. I'm on Logan now.</FONT></FONT></P>

<P><FONT COLOR="#FFFF00"><FONT SIZE=-1>Voice: OK, 429, its south of Old
82, I'm moving east on it.</FONT></FONT></P>

<P><FONT COLOR="#FFFF00"><FONT SIZE=-1>Unit #429: I'm still stationary
at the airbase. Its pulsating.</FONT></FONT></P>

<P><FONT COLOR="#FFFF00"><FONT SIZE=-1>Voice: Affirmative, I'm looking
at it through binoculars. It's got something protruding out the top of
it.</FONT></FONT></P>

<P><FONT COLOR="#FFFF00"><FONT SIZE=-1>Voice: I'm on Belmont now.</FONT></FONT></P>

<P><FONT COLOR="#FFFF00"><FONT SIZE=-1>Voice: It's over tracks now...</FONT></FONT></P>

<P><FONT COLOR="#FFFF00"><FONT SIZE=-1>Voice: It's hovering now.</FONT></FONT></P>

<P><FONT COLOR="#FFFF00"><FONT SIZE=-1>Voice: I see it now, too.</FONT></FONT></P>

<P><FONT COLOR="#FFFF00"><FONT SIZE=-1>Voice: It looks like it's flickering
more now and it's east of me now. I'm heading east on Old 82...</FONT></FONT></P>

<P><FONT COLOR="#FFFF00"><FONT SIZE=-1>Voice: I've got a pretty good view
from here.</FONT></FONT></P>

<P><FONT COLOR="#FFFF00"><FONT SIZE=-1>Voice: I'm dead east on it, it's
slightly north of us.</FONT></FONT></P>

<P><FONT COLOR="#FFFF00"><FONT SIZE=-1>Voice: It's extremely bright, really
bright.</FONT></FONT></P>

<P><FONT COLOR="#FFFF00"><FONT SIZE=-1>Voice: It's all the way into Liberty
now, into Hubbard now...</FONT></FONT></P>

<P><FONT COLOR="#FFFF00"><FONT SIZE=-1>Unit #998: Is Howland reporting
sightings?</FONT></FONT></P>

<P><FONT COLOR="#FFFF00"><FONT SIZE=-1>[Dispatch]: That is affirmative.</FONT></FONT></P>

<P><FONT COLOR="#FFFF00"><FONT SIZE=-1>UNIT #2223: I've got a visual on
both of them, I'm sure you know what I'm talking about.</FONT></FONT></P>

<P><FONT COLOR="#FFFF00"><FONT SIZE=-1>CONTROL: 10-4. We have multiple
departments right now that have sightings on it.</FONT></FONT></P>

<P><FONT COLOR="#FFFF00"><FONT SIZE=-1>UNIT #2223: OK, I've got them both.
I've got Howland saying it looks like it's in the area of Warren Road;
Liberty says it's down near Hubbard.</FONT></FONT></P>

<P><FONT COLOR="#FFFF00"><FONT SIZE=-1>CONTROL: If you see anything close
and can identify it, let us know.</FONT></FONT></P>

<P><FONT COLOR="#FFFF00"><FONT SIZE=-1>UNIT #2223: Affirmative.</FONT></FONT></P>

<P><FONT COLOR="#FFFF00"><FONT SIZE=-1>Voice: I'm past 84-Lumber, still
eastbound. It's southeast of my location.</FONT></FONT></P>

<P><FONT COLOR="#FFFF00"><FONT SIZE=-1>Voice: It doesn't seem like it moved
at all from where I'm at.</FONT></FONT></P>

<P><FONT COLOR="#FFFF00"><FONT SIZE=-1>Voice: OK, are you by yourself,
or is there someone documenting the observation also?</FONT></FONT></P>

<P><FONT COLOR="#FFFF00"><FONT SIZE=-1>Voice: I'm at the airbase, I've
got the security guard out here. He doesn't know what to make of it either.
We can see it from right here.</FONT></FONT></P>

<P><FONT COLOR="#FFFF00"><FONT SIZE=-1>Voice: Did you ask Liberty Dispatch
the outcome of the FAA inquiry?</FONT></FONT></P>

<P><FONT COLOR="#FFFF00"><FONT SIZE=-1>UNIT #433: Last check, radar at
the airport was advising nothing on their screens. They wouldn't tell us
anyway if it's anything to do with the military. We've had another 'Hangar
7' happen in Trumbull County. [end of transcript excerpt]</FONT></FONT></P>

</UL>

<P><FONT COLOR="#FFFF00"><FONT SIZE=-1>As dawn approached, the low-flying
objects ascended to higher altitude, where they took on the appearance
of stars. However, several officers continued to insist that what they
saw was not stars or planets. This is clearly supported by the radio chatter
on the 911 tape, where it is apparent that officers in separate locations
are triangulating on objects that are close to the ground. This could not
happen if the officers were seeing celestial objects.</FONT></FONT></P>

<P><FONT COLOR="#FFFF00"><FONT SIZE=-1>Also near dawn, jets reportedly
flew through the area, though it is not clear whether they were responding
to the UFO sightings.</FONT></FONT></P>

<P><FONT COLOR="#FFFF00"><FONT SIZE=-1>As is often the case, this UFO incident
took place within close proximity to a secretive military installation.
According to Young, &quot;the region in question is adjacent to a Defense
Logistics Agency and National Defense Stockpile, one of the biggest radar/air
defense installations in the United States. The Youngstown Municipal Radar
Air Defense Agency is also within the locality.&quot;</FONT></FONT></P>

<P><FONT COLOR="#FFFF00"><FONT SIZE=-1>Some police officers apparently
suspected that secret military activity might account for the events. &quot;Most
people don't realize that this air base out here is one of the best kept
secrets in the whole damn country,&quot; a Hubbard police officer told
Young. &quot;Don't kid yourself. You wouldn't believe the hardware,&quot;

he insisted.</FONT></FONT></P>

<P><FONT COLOR="#FFFF00"><FONT SIZE=-1>While many questions remain unanswered,
what is clear is that a UFO incident of potentially enormous significance,
documented on police audiotape and witnessed by dozens of personnel from
ten or more police departments, the FAA, the Air Force and at least one
major television station, would have gone entirely unreported but for a
lucky discovery by an independent UFO investigator, Kenny Young. CNI News
commends and thanks Young for his continuing pursuit of this case.</FONT></FONT></P>

<P><FONT COLOR="#FFFF00"><FONT SIZE=-1>And we ask: WHY are cases like this
covered up? WHO is afraid? WHAT are they hiding?</FONT></FONT></P>

<P><FONT COLOR="#FFFF00"><FONT SIZE=-1>CNI News believes the foregoing
information demonstrates clear, official intent to keep this case out of
public view. Furthermore, it seems likely that there are many other cases
of this kind that are not and perhaps never will be discovered, unless
deception and denial concerning UFOs is brought to an end.</FONT></FONT></P>
