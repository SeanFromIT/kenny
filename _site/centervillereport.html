Activity at police dispatch headquarters, meanwhile, was anything but routine.</font></b>					<p><b><font face="Arial,Helvetica">Phone lines began to light up with citizen complaints of bizarre 'flashing in the sky' and electrical disruptions that seized a large area from Lakeview Drive to Bethel Road, Stone Lake and Linden. One after another the calls came in.</font></b>					<p><b><font face="Arial,Helvetica">"Centerville Police?" said the flustered police dispatcher to yet another caller.&nbsp;</font></b>					<p><b><font face="Arial,Helvetica">"Has the whole street called?" came the voice on the other line.</font></b>					<p><b><font face="Arial,Helvetica">"Oh my God�" the caller could be heard exclaiming.&nbsp; "I saw it, it was right over my house and it hovered down� I can't believe I'm saying this! It looked like an ALIEN SHIP�!"</font></b>					<p><b><font face="Arial,Helvetica">Needless to say, this morning would not be so routine at police dispatch headquarters.</font></b>					<p><b><font face="Arial,Helvetica">The resident on Lakeview Drive, later contacted for this report, contends that a solid physical object was present in the skies near Stingley Elementary School in Centerville.					This object was hovering at near treetop level and would interact with nearby power lines, causing an arcing 'flash' that would send a powerful explosive report across the sleepy and confused neighborhood.&nbsp;&nbsp; <a href="#1">1</a></font></b>					<p><b><font face="Arial,Helvetica">This detail is consistent with callers heard on the 9-1-1 police tapes of the incident, obtained through the diligence of UFO investigator Bruce M. Forrester, Jr., of Bellbrook, Ohio, in which area residents inform of the sky lighting up and electrical disruptions.					One caller said the source of the bright flashing was from somewhere 'near Stingley school.'&nbsp;&nbsp; <a href="#2">2</a></font></b>					<p><b><font face="Arial,Helvetica">The Lakeview Drive resident who lives across from the school, and who also observed the object with his wife, said: "This house-sized object was a saucer-shaped metallic structure, polished aluminum surface with alternating sets of rotating, flare-like lights.					The two sets of lights clearly rotated in opposite directions and were very bright, consisting of several colors ranging from yellow, amber, white and blue. There was no smoke or exhaust that I could see."</font></b>					<p><b><font face="Arial,Helvetica">This UFO was somehow interacting with power lines near Stingley Elementary School, according to the primary claimant.					After each blinding explosion the air pressure in the neighborhood would "change" with a loud concussion, and at that point all the power would go out across the neighborhood.					Following this disruption, the UFO would vanish from its place at treetop level near the school.					The same - or a separate, identical object - would 'reappear' over an adjacent field as the power in the region would slowly restore.					This object would then assume a slow path and amble back toward the school to its previous position where it would again explode with a flash after making some kind of 'arcing' contact with the power lines.					This procedure, as said by the Lakeview Drive resident, would repeat several times.</font></b>					<p><b><font face="Arial,Helvetica">Trees in the area were burnt during this drama, branches and limbs were said by the Lakeview Drive witness to flame and 'glitter' for several hours after the incident.					The sparkling glitter was likened to flashing 4th of July fireworks.&nbsp;&nbsp;<a href="#3">3</a></font></b>					<p><b><font face="Arial,Helvetica">"I wish that there was a good explanation for this," said the Lakeview Drive witness, a 25-year old father of a newly born baby and working in 'financial services.'					"It moved over the school and came down in the field. I saw it raise and lower. I know it was controlled and I wish I had somebody to come to my door and lay it on the line, just give me a good answer for all this."</font></b>					<p><b><font face="Arial,Helvetica">According to police logs obtained from the Centerville Police Department, the station was swamped with the calls coming in at around 5:37 a.m. and police officers were dispatched to the scene shortly thereafter.&nbsp;&nbsp; <a href="#4">4</a></font></b>					<p><b><font face="Arial,Helvetica">Fire logs obtained from the Washington Township fire department indicate that a fire truck was dispatched to the location at 5:48a.m. and another unit sent at 5:58 a.m.&nbsp;&nbsp; <a href="#5">5</a></font></b>					<p><b><font face="Arial,Helvetica">Making this situation a tad more interesting are reports that emergency responders in the fire department ladder truck also saw the UFO, and the gauges on their emergency vehicle 'went funny.'</font></b>					<p><b><font face="Arial,Helvetica">"The firemen were repeatedly asking me for descriptions of what I saw, and I told them and they said 'that's the same thing we saw.'" According to Lakeview Drive resident, citing firemen and police officers that loudly communicated with each other at the scene of the bedlam.&nbsp;&nbsp; <a href="#6">6</a></font></b>					<p><b><font face="Arial,Helvetica">One area resident, standing in the midst of the hustle and bustle, jokingly said: "It must be Osama Bin Laden."</font></b>					<p><b><font face="Arial,Helvetica">"I told the two fire officers what I saw and asked them if I sounded like a complete lunatic," said the Lakeview Drive resident. "He told me that I was not a lunatic and that they saw it too, and it made the gauges in their truck go nuts."</font></b>					<p><b><font face="Arial,Helvetica">Following this tantalizing lead, an inquiry was made to find out if emergency responders were also witness to this UFO.</font></b>					<p><b><font face="Arial,Helvetica">Telephone greetings to the Centerville Fire Department's "Station 41" about this issue were not warmly received, and the simple phone call requesting some basic information on the March 6 dispatch was rejected.</font></b>					<p><b><font face="Arial,Helvetica">Lieutenant Sarah Lee, handling the inquiry to her department, advised that (oh joy!) she could not be of any help.					To the contrary, the wagons were circling, the mote was being filled and hatches were being battened down as it was announced that any incoming inquiry must be made via "written request."</font></b>					<p><b><font face="Arial,Helvetica">"Why don't you call Wright Patterson Air Force Base?" she said after listening briefly to the weird 9-1-1 tape by telephone.</font></b>					<p><b><font face="Arial,Helvetica">"Wright Pat can help you more than I can. Unfortunately, I cannot answer any of your questions," then advised Lt. Lee of the Centerville Fire Department. "It is routine procedure and policy for us to not 'give out' information without proper authorization." <a href="#7">7</a></font></b>					<p><b><font face="Arial,Helvetica">Like sheesh, you'd think this was an inquiry to Ft. Knox about their security methods.&nbsp;</font></b>					<p><b><font face="Arial,Helvetica">Suddenly the operations and practices of this basic public agency seemed to be operating like the Freedom of Information Office of the super-secret "Blue Room" of Wright Patterson Air Force Base, the very base the inquiry was referred to.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<a href="#8">8</a></font></b>					<p><b><font face="Arial,Helvetica">A friendly letter was then penned to Fire Chief Parks, basically begging to be put in contact with the emergency responders who were on the scene of the UFO incident on March 6.</font></b>					<p><b><font face="Arial,Helvetica">"I am not sure who gave you your information but it appears they were aware of something we did not see or share in," said Fire Chief Kenneth C. Parks in response to the plea.&nbsp;&nbsp; <a href="#9">9</a></font></b>					<p><b><font face="Arial,Helvetica">Apparently, The Chief also did not take kindly to the request for contact info with the emergency responders who were dispatched to the scene on March 6: "Our people are required by policy to refrain from discussing fire department actions without proper authorization.					By policy, their reports are their response to any questions, outside of court action."</font></b>					<p><b><font face="Arial,Helvetica">Chief Parks speaks and the specter of court action is now vocalized. Courtesy, begging and pleading did no good, it seems, as the firemen at the scene will continue to remain anonymous and, interestingly, a friendly chat with a UFO investigator has been averted. One for officialdom.</font></b>					<p><b><font face="Arial,Helvetica">But before the curious reader might find refreshing the idea of friendly openness and neighborly cooperation from the City of Centerville and her hirelings, there is also the attitude of Centerville's Assistant City Manager, Judy Gilleland.</font></b>					<p><b><font face="Arial,Helvetica">Gilleland was unaware of the mass confusion of March 6 despite assuring that she 'would be' aware of any such report as was described to her. This assistant City Manager seemed to take little interest or concern in the report of an object hovering over Stingley Elementary School.&nbsp;&nbsp; <a href="#10">10</a></font></b>					<p><b><font face="Arial,Helvetica">"I believe I would know about downed power lines and trees and again, have heard nothing of the sort.&nbsp;</font></b>					<p><b><font face="Arial,Helvetica">"Good news for us," she said before curiously adding: "perhaps bad news for you?"</font></b>					<p><b><font face="Arial,Helvetica">Assistant City Manager Gilleland, Fire Chief Parks and Lietenant Lee were all advised that there should be some concern of radioactivity near the site of Stingley Elementary School. These public employees clearly expressed a lethargic lack of motivation for the nature of the event described by witness on March 6. Is this a dangerous complacency that reeks of ultimate disregard for public safety in an uncertain time? Could Homeland Security be any more proud?&nbsp;&nbsp; <a href="#11">11</a></font></b>					<p><b><font face="Arial,Helvetica">There may or may not be a firm explanation for the object described over Stingley school, but even if it were to have been some classified military operation (Wright Patterson Air Force Base in Dayton/Beavercreek is less than 19-miles northwest), there should be some valid concern regarding a military operation so low over a residential quarter and near a school. Further, the type of propulsion method used on such a classified project and the possibility of lingering radiation near the school could pose threatening conditions for families and children in the areas of the school, Lakeview Drive, Bethel Road and Linden Road. This is and should be a sober concern.&nbsp;</font></b>					<p><b><font face="Arial,Helvetica">When notified of this concern and asked to undertake action to check for radiation readings, the public officials of Centerville, Ohio took no safety measures in response to the appeal for caution.</font></b>					<p><b><font face="Arial,Helvetica">Instead, public hirelings in Centerville have dismissed this episode as a case of 'wires arcing in high winds.' <a href="#12">12</a></font></b>					<p><b><font face="Arial,Helvetica">An inquiry made with the National Weather Service at Wilmington, Ohio revealed that although there was a high wind alert earlier on March 5th, high winds during the time of the reported incident were not an issue. Between 4 ? 5 a.m. on March 6, 2004, temperatures and conditions in Centerville, Ohio were in the mid 40s with winds out of the Northwest at only 12 miles per hour.&nbsp; Not quite the high winds previously reported.&nbsp;&nbsp;<a href="#13"> 13</a></font></b>					<p><b><font face="Arial,Helvetica">Further complicating the 'high wind' dismissal would be comments from a telephone receptionist at DP &amp; L (Dayton Power &amp; Light) in which the cause of a power outages near Lakeview Drive on March 6 was due to a "circuit lockout" that took place from 5:34 until 10:45 a.m. resulting in service disruption, with no mention of high winds being made.&nbsp;&nbsp; <a href="#14">14</a></font></b>					<p><b><font face="Arial,Helvetica">As for the Lakeview Drive resident, he isn't very comfortable with the situation.&nbsp;</font></b>					<p><b><font face="Arial,Helvetica">"It's clear to me that something blew up there where the burnt trees are," he said. There is no transformer there to blow up. That concerns me, given the magnitude of the explosion."</font></b>					<p><b><font face="Arial,Helvetica">The incident early in the morning of March 6, 2004 is real. Multiple callers to police headquarters advised of an unusual situation and upon arrival, emergency responders did address the situation of arcing power lines along with downed tree limbs. But essentially the strangeness of this whole situation rests with the testimony of the Lakeview Drive resident and his wife, both claim a very sensational, physical and intelligently controlled object situated low in the sky near Stingley school. This is reflected on the emergency 9-1-1 police tapes as the caller considers his own words with disbelief at what he is claiming to observe in the sky near his home.					While others in the neighborhood were indeed alarmed and also calling police headquarters, they were only reporting generic 'flashing' in the sky along with power disruptions. The Lakeview Drive resident further informs that officers with the fire department did tell him they saw this object too, and the instrumentation on their vehicle was oddly effected, Most unfortunately, and also quite curious, is that this cannot be independently verified as per Chief Parks' unusually harsh reference to court action.</font></b>					<p><b><font face="Arial,Helvetica">And disturbingly, the Lakeview Drive resident also reports being sick in the last week of March, feeling nausea with a headache, a sickness he would describe as 'low blood sugar' even though he has never been diagnosed with this sickness. He also reports concern that his infant has experienced hair loss, although this could be normal as babies sometimes do lose their hair.</font></b>					<p><b><font face="Arial,Helvetica">Or then again, perhaps it's just those high winds.</font></b>					<br>&nbsp;					<br>&nbsp;					<p><b><font face="Arial,Helvetica"><font color="#F87B57"><font size=+2>NOTES</font></font></font></b>					<br>&nbsp;					<p><a NAME="1"></a><b><font face="Arial,Helvetica"><font color="#F87B57"><font size=-1>1.&nbsp;					Friday, March 26, 2004 telephone interview with Lakeview Drive resident, also involved in the conversations were investigator Nancy Talbott of BLT Research (Cambridge, Massachusettes).
