On Pickaway Farm</font></font></b>

<font face="Arial Narrow"><font size=+1>One of the �flying discs� which
have been puzzling aviators all over the United States was believed Saturday
to have been found on a Pickaway county farm.</font></font>
<p><font face="Arial Narrow"><font size=+1>Sherman Campbell, who lives
on the Westfall road in Wayne township, near the Pickaway-Ross county line,
reported the finding of a star-shaped silver foil covered object which
he believes is one of the mysterious �flying saucers.�</font></font>
<p><font face="Arial Narrow"><font size=+1>While working in the field he
spotted a strange object. He described his find as 50 inches high, 48 inches
wide and weighing about two pounds. He said the silver foil was stretched
over a wooden frame. The star-shaped object had six points.</font></font>
<p><font face="Arial Narrow"><font size=+1>He said there was a balloon
attached which had deflated and there was no way of knowing how big it
was.</font></font>
<p><font face="Arial Narrow"><font size=+1>Discovery of the object was
the first reported in the country. A Coast Guardsman on the west coast
reported photographing one from a distance, but no one has seen one of
the �flying discs� close.</font></font>

<p><b><font face="Arial Narrow"><font size=+3>Second �Disc� Recovered In
County Area</font></font></b>
<blockquote><font face="Arial Narrow"><font size=-1>Source: The Circleville
[Ohio] Herald</font></font>
<br><font face="Arial Narrow"><font size=-1>Tuesday, July 8, 1947</font></font></blockquote>
<font face="Arial Narrow"><font size=+1>A second mysterious silver foil-covered
six-pointed contraption was delivered to the office of The Circleville
Herald, Tuesday afternoon, by David C. Heffner, Route 1, Soutsville, who
said he found it on the fence line of his farm on the old Tarlton road
four and one-half miles east of Circleville.</font></font>
<p><font face="Arial Narrow"><font size=+1>The strange gadget, its origin
and purpose undetermined, is quite similar to the first which was found
Saturday on the farm of Sherman Campbell on the Westfall road in Pickaway
county near the Ross county line.</font></font>
<p><font face="Arial Narrow"><font size=+1>Visions of a �landing� of one
of the now world-mystifying �flying saucers� near Circleville were conjured
when Mr. Heffner reported his find Tuesday to Sheriff Charles Radcliff
and to The Herald.</font></font>
<p><font face="Arial Narrow"><font size=+1>Although generally believed
to have been sent aloft in connection with weather observations the possibility
remained that the queer contraption may be one of those strange objects
identified thus far throughout the nation merely as �flying saucers.�</font></font>
<p><font face="Arial Narrow"><font size=+1>Unlike the first find in Pickaway
county, Tuesday�s find has attached to it the almost complete remains of
a thin rubber balloon which � when inflated � must have measured at least
10 feet in diameter.</font></font>
<p><font face="Arial Narrow"><font size=+1>The markings on the newly found
gadget are: �ML 387, B-AP, Mfg. By Chase.�</font></font>

<font face="Arial Narrow"><font size=+1>Circleville had the distinction,
Wednesday, of being the first city in the nation to have on display two
queer six-point foil-covered box-like contraptions which may [illegible

<p><font face="Arial Narrow"><font size=+1>Although [illegible text] the
�flying saucers� [illegible text] not been [illegible text] Wednesday,
and although press dispatches said that 80 weather stations have been sending
aloft foil-covered gadgets in connection with weather observations, the
mysterious gadgets found on Pickaway county farms presented a possible
solution to the �flying saucer� conundrum baffling the nation.</font></font>
<p><font face="Arial Narrow"><font size=+1>Excitement buzzed throughout
the United States early Tuesday night when an alleged �flying disc� was
reported found on a ranch in eastern New Mexico. Shortly afterward, however,
an Army Air Corps announcement said the find was a contraption whose description
tallied closely with the gadgets discovered in Pickaway county and placed
on exhibition in the office of The Circleville Herald.</font></font>
<p><a NAME="South_Bloomfield"></a><font face="Arial Narrow"><font size=+1>A
third similar box-like gadget covered with silver foil was found Tuesday
afternoon on a farm near South Bloomfield.</font></font>
<p><font face="Arial Narrow"><font size=+1>Last Saturday, the news was
flashed throughout the nation that the first such contraption had been
found on the farm of Sherman Campbell on the Westfall road in Pickaway
county eight miles south of Circleville.</font></font>
<p><font face="Arial Narrow"><font size=+1>The second such find was reported
to Sheriff Charles Radcliff Tuesday afternoon by David C. Heffner, who
said he discovered it on a line fence on his farm on the old Tarlton road
four and one half miles east of Circleville. Mr. Heffner�s post office
address is Route 1, Stoutsville.</font></font>
<p><font face="Arial Narrow"><font size=+1>The gadgets found by Mr. Campbell
and Mr. Heffner were brought to the Circleville Herald. Each is constructed
of a light wood frame. Only a remnant of the thin rubber balloon remained
attached to the Campbell find, but the other contraption discovered on
the Heffner farm includes most of the remains of the balloon which must
have measured more than 15 feet in diameter when it was inflated. That
device bears the markings: �ML 387, B-AP. Mfg. By Chase.�</font></font>
<p><font face="Arial Narrow"><font size=+1>Followed in the skies by radar
the strange gadgets found near Circleville would have � when whirling in
the air � appeared like a �flying saucer.�</font></font>
<p><font face="Arial Narrow"><font size=+1>As to the box-like object reported
in New Mexico Tuesday night, identification as a bit of of �meteorological
equipment� was made by Warrant Officer Irving Newton, Stetsonville, Wis.,
an official of the Eighth Army headquarters weather department.</font></font>
<p><font face="Arial Narrow"><font size=+1>The Fort Worth office said the
�disc� was only a bit of equipment used by Army and weather bureau officials.</font></font>
<p><font face="Arial Narrow"><font size=+1>An amplyfing statement by public
relations officer capt. G. F. Haist said:</font></font>
<p><font face="Arial Narrow"><font size=+1>�Experts have identified the
equipment as a box kite � or a �rawin high altitude sounding device� used
by meteorologists.�</font></font>
<p><font face="Arial Narrow"><font size=+1>The original announcement of
the discovery of a so-called �flying disc� came from the Foster ranch near
Corona, N.M. An employee on the ranch found the balloon.</font></font>
<p><font face="Arial Narrow"><font size=+1>An Air Corps public relations
officer at Roswell, N.M., Lt. Warren Haught, electrified the country with
his report of finding a �disc,� but a few hours later the report blew up
with the Fort Worth identification.</font></font>
<p><font face="Arial Narrow"><font size=+1>Brig. Gen. Roger Ramey, commanding
general of the Eight Air Force field, had insisted the �disc� evidently
was nothing other than a weather or radar instrument of some sort.</font></font>
<p><font face="Arial Narrow"><font size=+1>For a time officers planned
to bring the �disc� to Wright Field, Dayton, O., by plane. Its identification
as remnants of a weather balloon cancelled those plans.</font></font>
