<p><br>HELENA, July 10 (AP) � Federal weather officials said Thursday they
were convinced a balloon found in an eastern Montana farmyard Wednesday
was a common �Pilot� balloon used by weathermen to determine wind conditions
aloft.
<p>Farmer D.H. Good found the red rubber balloon near Baker Wednesday.
<p>Pilot balloons are released by weathermen who study their movement in
the air to determine wind drift. Attached to the spheres are small battery
light attachments, for use at night.

<p>BAKER, July 10 (AP) � D.H. Good, farmer west of this eastern Montana
town, reported Thursday he found a red balloon 26 inches long in front
of his farmhouse Wednesday.
<p>Attached to the sphere was a half-ounce bottle filled with a substance
resembling ashes.
<p>Tuesday night, Baker residents watched an object shuttling back and
forth in the sky, and a couple sleeping on a porch early that morning reported
seeing something flying overhead.
