(his name is on file). Wehad some concern that the NUFORC report originated from a resident of "472Skaggs Road" (this location is listed on the original NUFORC report), butthis was not the case as the resident at</font></b><br><b><font face="Arial,Helvetica">472 did not report anything to NUFORC,reporting the 11/21 situation only to the police department. This gentleman,who had heard the screams and called the police, recalled that the situationbegan -he thought- around 7:00 p.m. on Friday, Nov. 21 when he heard bloodcurdling screams coming from the field behind his house. He told us thatthe screams consisted of 3 verbal sounds of "Help me, Oh God, somebodyhelp me!" and 1 long nonverbal scream.&nbsp; According to this witness,the duration of the blood curdling screams lasted about 2-minutes. He saidthat within 20 minutes he had called the police. He recalled that the police,fire and rescue squad searched the field up until about 10 p.m.. The witnesssaid that he also conducted a short search. When asked if the screams soundedlike someone in trouble, the witness replied with a worried expressionthat the person sounded to be in certain distress. He said that he didnot see a UFO, but did add that the animals in the neighborhood were behavingwildly. The witness agreed to an over-the-shoulder photo of him pointinginto the field where he heard the screams.</font></b><p><b><font face="Arial,Helvetica">Next we stopped at the home of the firstUFO witness, a UK psychologist. This house is almost one quarter of a mileup a winding road from our first subject. We arrived at his home at around3:55 p.m. and spoke at length to the witness. He recounted the event forus. He added that during the UFO sighting, his son tried to use his cellphone but it would not work. He again said that the search and rescue personnelarrived in the field 20-minutes after the UFO had departed. The UK psychologistinformed that after the report of this incident appeared on the internet,he received calls and E-mails from&nbsp; folks with the University of NewMexico and others (he copied us on two E-mails). He said that he did readthe article online and said it was largely accurate, except that only 1of his two sons had heard the scream. He said that the screams were heardby his son who was accompanied by a friend. The witness agreed to an over-the-shoulderphoto of him pointing toward the field where the UFO was sighted.</font></b><p><b><font face="Arial,Helvetica">Our next stop was at Shoney's restaurantnear the Interstate 64 exit at Morehead. While there we spoke to a waitressand asked if anyone there had seen a UFO recently. The waitress was shockedand told us that about two weeks earlier, she was riding with her sisterwhen they noticed an unusual yellow light in the sky. She said they watchedand discussed the light for about 30 seconds. When asked to point to thearea where she saw the object, she gestured toward the Skaggs Road vicinity.She also said that on a Sunday evening, also around 2 weeks ago, she waskept awake by a helicopter flying repeatedly over her house from 11:00p.m. to 1:00 a.m.</font></b><p><b><font face="Arial,Helvetica">At around 5:30 p.m. we went to the homeof a volunteer paramedic with the Fire and Rescue Squad of Morehead. Aftera chat with this person, we then drove directly to the Rowan County Fireand Rescue Squad and at approx. 5:45 p.m. sat down at a folding table fora brief chat</font></b><br><b><font face="Arial,Helvetica">with several Rowan County Fire andRescue Squad personnel in the center of the fire house. A few of the officerspresent had participated in the search and rescue operation. They advisedthat the call about the screaming woman had been first reported by a residenton 472 Skaggs Rd. on Nov. 21 at 21:45 military time, or 9:45 p.m. E.D.T.They, along with the Morehead police, responded and found no one. Therewas no helicopter involved in the search operation, and they focused ona pond in the area. They used a thermal imaging device. They were alsoasked about the report of a 'baby' seen in the area and, referring to theirlogs, said that there was an unusual report from a female motorist fromIndiana on Thanksgiving morning. The motorist, traveling near Morehead,had called around 4:00 a.m. to report a 3-year old baby wearing only adiaper walking near the roadside near Route 60. The motorist did not stopto help but only continued on, calling from a location miles away. Thepolice responded but found no baby, and no baby was reported missing. Whenasked for any other reports of unusual interest, we were told that monthsearlier, persons had complained of a helicopter or airplane crash in thecounty when no wreckage could be found, and a separate report from Flemingsburg,KY almost 6-months earlier of a woman found in a field with amnesia. Altogether,we spoke to 5 members of the Rowan County Rescue Squad and three of thesepeople were involved in the search.&nbsp; They told us that they had onlyheard rumors of the UFO sighting involving a female abduction, and theysuggested the police may know more. One officer referenced the UK psychologistas the witness to the UFO abducting a woman, but we explained that thiswas not his testimony. It appears the report of a 'baby' does not directlyrelate to the Nov. 21 incident (Note: The Police Dept. earlier said thesearch for the 'screaming woman' was on Sunday the 23rd, but when checkingthe fire department run sheets, nothing could be found under that date.)</font></b><p><b><font face="Arial,Helvetica">Our final stop at the Silver Road residenceof Mrs. Woods, who also claims to have also seen a UFO on Friday, Nov.21st. We arrived at Approx. 6:15 p.m. and Mrs. Woods (name changed, onfile), told us that she and her daughter had been putting up Christmaslights outside. It was dusk when they were finishing up. We pressed heron the time and she held to her belief that</font></b><br><b><font face="Arial,Helvetica">it was around 6:30 p.m. when they werefinishing up and had spotted a white light in the vicinity of the field.She described the light as "zig zagging" around and coming down. Once behindthe trees it looked to be jumping up and down and reminded her corn poppingup. She said that she bent over for a moment, looked back up and the lightwas gone.&nbsp; She said that the animals were going crazy in the neighborhoodand that her own dog had hid under the bed whimpering.&nbsp; She also saidthat she did not hear the screams, but when she came back into the housethe phones were ringing and people were calling to see if she and her daughterwere all right. Apparently they had heard about the screaming woman overpolice scanners, and thought it might have been Mrs. Woods and her daughter.She said that after the UFO sighting, her clocks were not working properlyand several had quit working altogether. She also spoke of nose bleedssince the UFO sighting, but believes they are a result of her home beingtoo dry. She was not prompted on these questions and volunteered them withoutbeing led. We thanked Mrs. Woods for her time and we left approx. 7:00p.m.</font></b><p><b><font face="Arial,Helvetica">Filed,</font></b><br><b><font face="Arial,Helvetica">December 8, 2003</font></b><br><b><font face="Arial,Helvetica">Donnie Blessing, Kenny Young</font></b><br>&nbsp;<br>&nbsp;<br><br><br><br><center><p><b><font face="Arial,Helvetica"><a href="https://kenny.anomalyresponse.com/moreheadindex.html">RETURNTO THE MOREHEAD INCIDENT INDEX PAGE</a></font></b><p><hr WIDTH="100%"><p><b><font face="Arial,Helvetica">UFO RESEARCH</font></b><br><b><font face="Arial,Helvetica"><a href="https://home.fuse.net/ufo">Returnto MAIN PAGE</a> |&nbsp; <a href="mailto:anomalyresponse@gmail.com">E-mail Questionsor Comments</a></font></b></center></td></tr></table></center><br>&nbsp;<br>&nbsp;</body></html>
