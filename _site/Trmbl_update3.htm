<P><FONT COLOR="#FFFF00"><FONT SIZE=+1>Interview with Captain Keytack</FONT></FONT>
</P>

<P><FONT COLOR="#FFFF00"><FONT SIZE=-1>This afternoon I contacted the U.S.
Air Force base in Vienna, Ohio at 3976 King Graves Rd, Vienna OH 44473.
My call was to the 910th Air Lift Wing Security Police Division regarding
the UFO incident from 1994.</FONT></FONT></P>

<P><FONT COLOR="#FFFF00"><FONT SIZE=-1>After explaining the nature of my
call, it was then transferred to the public affairs office where I spoke
with Captain John Keytack.</FONT></FONT></P>

<P><FONT COLOR="#FFFF00"><FONT SIZE=-1>Only upon the first few utterances
to Mr. Keytack of my call, he immediately broke into dismissive comments,
stating repeatedly: &quot;I assure you, that did not happen. It never,
ever happened, this is all pure fiction.&quot;</FONT></FONT></P>

<P><FONT COLOR="#FFFF00"><FONT SIZE=-1>Stunned and floundering by his unshakable
comments, I could tell that the tone he was establishing for this telephone
discussion was a harsh one.</FONT></FONT></P>

<P><FONT COLOR="#FFFF00"><FONT SIZE=-1>&quot;Look Mister Young,&quot; Keytack
argued with a paced, assured methodology, &quot;we can go through alot
of time here, but I'm telling you right now that this NEVER happened.&quot;</FONT></FONT></P>

<P><FONT COLOR="#FFFF00"><FONT SIZE=-1>His remarks were made before I could
ever explain the basis of my inquiry.</FONT></FONT></P>

<P><FONT COLOR="#FFFF00"><FONT SIZE=-1>&quot;Let me tell you,&quot; he
soundly guaranteed, &quot;that when things happen here, they get passed
on to me. I've been at the base since June of 1989, I am chief of public
affairs, full-time... not a weekend warrior. I am intimately aware of everything,
EVERYTHING that's going on around here. What you are saying, Mister Young,
has NEVER happened.&quot;</FONT></FONT></P>

<P><FONT COLOR="#FFFF00"><FONT SIZE=-1>I took my turn at bat and set the
record straight with Captain Keytack, explaining to him my acquisition
of 9-1-1 tapes and witness inteviews with police officers involved, one
as recent as earlier this same afternoon. I then offered to forward Captain
Keytack a copy of the tape.</FONT></FONT></P>

<P><FONT COLOR="#FFFF00"><FONT SIZE=-1>&quot;I don't know what information
you have,&quot; he declared, as if in full combat mode, &quot;and even
if the information you have is valid. No sir, I am not soliciting your
information. Everything you're telling me is suspect.&quot;</FONT></FONT></P>

<P><FONT COLOR="#FFFF00"><FONT SIZE=-1>Jumping into gear with Captain Keytack,
I explained that he must have been aware of certain details prior to my
call, as he was presently denying a situation which I had not even advised
him of.</FONT></FONT></P>

<P><FONT COLOR="#FFFF00"><FONT SIZE=-1>&quot;Are you a UFO buff?&quot;
Keytack asked in a belittling tone.</FONT></FONT></P>

<P><FONT COLOR="#FFFF00"><FONT SIZE=-1>&quot;No sir,&quot; I countered,
&quot;I am a UFO investigator.&quot;</FONT></FONT></P>

<P><FONT COLOR="#FFFF00"><FONT SIZE=-1>&quot;I have no reason to solicit
from you any information regarding the incident you are referring to,&quot;
Keytack stated gruffly, &quot;and from my frame of reference, the incident
never took place.&quot;</FONT></FONT></P>

<P><FONT COLOR="#FFFF00"><FONT SIZE=-1>Keytack went on to challenge my
investigative pursuit of this case, and said that if I had conducted an
adequate investigation, I would have been informed by the local news media
that the event never happened.</FONT></FONT></P>

<P><FONT COLOR="#FFFF00"><FONT SIZE=-1>I then informed Keytack that I had
contacted numerous media agencies relevant to this specific investigation,
and had spoken at length with a reporter from Channel 33 News in Youngstown,
Ohio who was well aware of the incident.</FONT></FONT></P>

<P><FONT COLOR="#FFFF00"><FONT SIZE=-1>&quot;No sir,&quot; Keytack affirmed.
&quot;I know Ms. Stacey Adger from that station personally, and if something
like that would have happened, she would have told me. I did not get one
call or query.&quot;</FONT></FONT></P>

<P><FONT COLOR="#FFFF00"><FONT SIZE=-1>I then advised Keytack that it was
Adger herself on the 9-1-1 tape calling the dispatch office, and explained
that I, too, had spoken with Adger, and in my discussion with her, learned
that she had indeed contacted the FAA tower.</FONT></FONT></P>

<P><FONT COLOR="#FFFF00"><FONT SIZE=-1>&quot;I find that incredibly hard
to believe,&quot; Captain Keytack said, &quot;and being as actively involved
with the news media as I am, I am satisfied that there is no basis for
your inquiry.&quot;</FONT></FONT></P>

<P><FONT COLOR="#FFFF00"><FONT SIZE=-1>I asked Captain Keytack whether
or not he would have been later advised by the tower operator of a call
from the Trumbull County 9-1-1 Dispatch Office reporting a UFO situation.
He said that he would have been given the information. I asked him if he
would have been told of the encounter a security guard had with a Howland
Township police officer at the entrance regarding the UFO situation. He
said that he would have certainly been given that information.</FONT></FONT></P>

<P><FONT COLOR="#FFFF00"><FONT SIZE=-1>Keytack said that each morning he
reviews all incident and blotter reports, and has never seen anything relevant
to such an event at the airbase. He added that such an unusual entry appearing
in blotter reports or incident logs would 'stand out' to him.</FONT></FONT></P>

<P><FONT COLOR="#FFFF00"><FONT SIZE=-1>&quot;Look, I'm not just key staff
here, I'm the base public affairs officer,&quot; Captain Keytack said.
&quot;I inform the commander and key staff when something of media or public
interest is to be dealt with.&quot;</FONT></FONT></P>

<P><FONT COLOR="#FFFF00"><FONT SIZE=-1>I asked Captain Keytack if he was
interested in investigating this case with me, and if he would care to
confirm the event for himself by contacting the 9-1-1 dispatch center or
speaking with the Howland Township police office I spoke with earlier in
the day. He did not give any indications that he would seek to confirm
the information for himself.</FONT></FONT></P>

<P><FONT COLOR="#FFFF00"><FONT SIZE=-1>When asked about the number of persons
routinely on-duty during the overnight hours, the public affairs officer
stated that there is normally a certain amount of security and fire department
personnel on duty during the graveyard shift. He said that in the December
months, there may also be heating and cooling personnel who would have
been on duty. He added, however, that 'time and attendance' records are
kept for only two years.</FONT></FONT></P>

<P><FONT COLOR="#FFFF00"><FONT SIZE=-1>Captain Keytack then declared: &quot;You
might have very good intentions or incorrect information that you have
misinterpreted, I can't say, but I assure you that this never happened.
I have not previously heard of this...&quot;</FONT></FONT></P>

<P><FONT COLOR="#FFFF00"><FONT SIZE=-1>He then went on to add that he was
aware of a &quot;flying saucer&quot; flap happening nearly 18-miles north
of the base in the fall of 1989, but he stressed that the reports were
unrelated to the base itself.</FONT></FONT></P>

<P><FONT COLOR="#FFFF00"><FONT SIZE=-1>When asked about the details of
military jets reportedly in the air in pursuit of the UFO near the airbase,
Keytack advised that the jets wouldn't have been dispatched from the Vienna
facility.</FONT></FONT></P>

<P><FONT COLOR="#FFFF00"><FONT SIZE=-1>&quot;We have no jets on alert here...
it's not like you see on TV. Any jets seen in the air would've originated
elsewhere.&quot;</FONT></FONT></P>

<P><FONT COLOR="#FFFF00"><FONT SIZE=-1>He informed that no logs would be
available to indicate 'visiting' flights, as such log entries appear only
when such traffic lands for refueling or other purposes.</FONT></FONT></P>

<P><FONT COLOR="#FFFF00"><FONT SIZE=-1>He sought to deflect my inquiry
about the FAA tower controller by claiming that all calls and aircraft
routing is handled by Cleveland after midnight.</FONT></FONT></P>

<P><FONT COLOR="#FFFF00"><FONT SIZE=-1>&quot;Does that mean the tower is
unmanned?&quot; I asked.</FONT></FONT></P>

<P><FONT COLOR="#FFFF00"><FONT SIZE=-1>&quot;No,&quot; he replied.</FONT></FONT></P>

<P><FONT COLOR="#FFFF00"><FONT SIZE=-1>He went on to complain that the
person in the FAA tower would have told him about such an 'alleged' happening.
As I began to explain about the two calls placed to the FAA tower by the
9-1-1 dispatch office, he commented: &quot;I've even been called at home
on civilian aircraft incidents, and they surely never called me about this.&quot;</FONT></FONT></P>

<P><FONT COLOR="#FFFF00"><FONT SIZE=-1>I then expressed to Captain Keytack
that despite his certainty that the event never happened and his lack of
interest in my investigation, I would be sending him a copy of the 9-1-1
tapes, which I explained most normal people would be curious about. Along
with the tape, I informed that a Freedom of Information Act Request would
also be enclosed, relevant to the UFO incident. He indicated that I may
be wasting my time.</FONT></FONT></P>

<P><FONT COLOR="#FFFF00"><FONT SIZE=-1>That concluded our strange telephone
conversation.</FONT></FONT></P>

<P><FONT COLOR="#FFFF00"><FONT SIZE=-1>Keytack was the public affairs officer
I spoke with back in 1996 regarding this same investigation, and he employed
the same approach then as well, abrasively telling me: &quot;You have been
blasted with wrong information.&quot;</FONT></FONT></P>

<P><FONT COLOR="#FFFF00"><FONT SIZE=-1>I regret this afternoon's conversation
degenerated to a point, counter-point dispute, but the tone in which Mr.
Keytack handled my good-natured inquiry was anything but productive or
cooperative. Prior to even knowing the details or the nature of my call,
he was denying the event. </FONT></FONT></P>

<P><FONT COLOR="#FFFF00"><FONT SIZE=-1>During the phone call this afternoon,
I made the decision to engage Captain Keytack on the same level he had
confronted me on, and soundly refuted each dismissive comment he made by
referencing my acquisition of 9-1-1 tapes, witness interviews and media
inquiries. He had no sound rebuttals to deflect to my comments.</FONT></FONT></P>

<P><FONT COLOR="#FFFF00"><FONT SIZE=-1>I believe my decision to meet his
confrontational tone was warranted, because my approach was measured with
compromise and an acknowledged 'good faith' approach to the inquiry. I
explained to Mr. Keytack that despite his lack of information, that an
unusual event DID happen, and that I would be neglecting my duties as an
investigator if I were not to make the present inquiries with his office
that I was undertaking.</FONT></FONT></P>

<P><FONT COLOR="#FFFF00"><FONT SIZE=-1>I thought it very interesting that
he had no personal desire to acquire more information from me about this
event, and did not seek to confirm it for himself by contacting the 9-1-1
center or speaking with the officers involved, who I offered to put him
in touch with. I pondered if this were a normal response, as I would suspect
that it would be ones duty or concern to acquire and verify such information,
if not for his own interest, then for benefit of the facility and department
he represents.</FONT></FONT></P>

<P><FONT COLOR="#FFFF00"><FONT SIZE=-1>His absolute denial of the event
without being advised of any investigative findings indicates a strong
predisposition against any objective take on the Trumbull County incident,
and a surprisingly defensive posture.</FONT></FONT></P>

<P><FONT COLOR="#FFFF00"><FONT SIZE=-1>He will be forwarded an FOIA request
and copy of the tape at the following address:</FONT></FONT></P>
