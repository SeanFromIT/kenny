At 12:30 p.m., the B-2 Stealth Bomber wassighted over the Cincinnati area by dozens of people, including T.A.S.K.Investigator Ron Schaffner. This location is 36.5 miles northeast of Sparta,Kentucky. The flight path of the Stealth Bomber was said to have been fromnorth to south.&nbsp;</font></i><i><font face="Arial,Helvetica"></font></i><p><i><font face="Arial,Helvetica">A reporter on-board a traffic-helicopteroperated by one local news station was said to have also spotted the Stealth,and said, "I hope that thing's not armed!"&nbsp;</font></i><i><font face="Arial,Helvetica"></font></i><p><i><font face="Arial,Helvetica">Although it was suspected that the Stealthfly-over was due to the Dayton International Airshow occurring during theweekend, it was determined that the B-2 appearance was actually a pre-arrangedflyover for the employees GE plant in Evendale, as per a memo that wascirculated to GE employees a day in advance.&nbsp;</font></i><i><font face="Arial,Helvetica"></font></i><p><i><font face="Arial,Helvetica">Although there was some concern thatthe Stealth flyover would generate UFO reports, none was received. However,local news stations did receive numerous calls from the public that wantedto report the Stealth Bomber traveling overhead. This 'public recognitionfactor' enabled the witnesses to readily identify the strange looking plane.&nbsp;</font></i><i><font face="Arial,Helvetica"></font></i><p><i><font face="Arial,Helvetica">The Sparta, Kentucky report, however,presents a challenge to those seeking to apply the same explanation. Thereported object was visible for 5-minutes as it 'hung' in the air, wasdescribed as round, silver and wingless, and said to be a 'little biggerthan a car.' Furthermore, the witnesses stated that the object disappearedin 'the blink of an eye.'&nbsp;</font></i><i><font face="Arial,Helvetica"></font></i><p><i><font face="Arial,Helvetica">The physical descriptions reported bythe witnesses do not seem compatible with the physical and ballistic characteristicsexpected from the B2 Stealth Bomber.&nbsp;</font></i><i><font face="Arial,Helvetica"></font></i><p><i><font face="Arial,Helvetica">The next evening, Saturday, July 19at 7:30 p.m., Chris Heiert reported that two missile-like objects flewin tandem over a section of Alexandria, Kentucky, in Campbell County (32.5miles north- east of Sparta). The wingless objects were observed for nearly1-minute, were 'white' in color, and traveled due north. Air demonstrationsfor the Dayton International Airshow (64.5 miles north of the location)were not active during this time. The objects were reported at a high altitude.&nbsp;</font></i><i><font face="Arial,Helvetica"></font></i><p><i><font face="Arial,Helvetica">In our continuing investigations ofthe Alexandria and Sparta sightings, we will seek to explore aspects of'witness mis-perception' and 'false identifications' when dealing withthese reports. On the basis of the preliminary information available, thereseems to be no other prosaic explanation applicable.&nbsp;</font></i><i><font face="Arial,Helvetica"></font></i><p><hr WIDTH="100%"><b><font face="Arial,Helvetica"></font></b><p><b><font face="Arial,Helvetica">July, 1997 Reports&nbsp;</font></b><b><font face="Arial,Helvetica"></font></b><p><b><font face="Arial,Helvetica">WITNESS: KATHY XXXXXX and husband (Nameand phone # on file)&nbsp;</font></b><br><b><font face="Arial,Helvetica">DATE OF EVENT : Sunday night, July6, 1997&nbsp;</font></b><br><b><font face="Arial,Helvetica">DURATION OF EVENT: 25 minutes (if notmore)&nbsp;</font></b><br><b><font face="Arial,Helvetica">LOCATION: Suncreek Court, Delhi, Ohio(Hamilton County)&nbsp;</font></b><b><font face="Arial,Helvetica"></font></b><p><b><font face="Arial,Helvetica">DESCRIPTION OF EVENT : Looking to thewest from their residence, a husband and wife pair observe two �nocturnallights.� Their residence is up on a hill, with a good view of the horizonand neighborhood. No trees or powerlines are present to obstruct theirview.&nbsp;</font></b><b><font face="Arial,Helvetica"></font></b><p><b><font face="Arial,Helvetica">Living in Delhi, the witness says theyare familiar with and can see �all of the planes� that take off and landat the airport, and are comfortable with this traffic and can readily identifythe airplanes. She said that common air traffic comes in frequently, andusually circles around and travels from north to south. She said that atthe time though, there was no airport traffic proceeding towards or awayfrom the Greater Cincinnati Airport.&nbsp;</font></b><b><font face="Arial,Helvetica"></font></b><p><b><font face="Arial,Helvetica">When asked if there were other witnesses,she said, �I don�t think there will be too many. Who is going to be sittingout looking out the window at 9:45 p.m. at night?�&nbsp;</font></b><b><font face="Arial,Helvetica"></font></b><p><b><font face="Arial,Helvetica">She characterized her husband and herselfas coherent and sane people. As she spoke, she sounded cognizant and reasonable.&nbsp;</font></b><b><font face="Arial,Helvetica"></font></b><p><b><font face="Arial,Helvetica">There were reportedly two objects involvedin the sighting. The first object was �suddenly noticed� in the sky. Itlooked like a very bright light that was idle and not moving, and the witnessadded that it was �definetely not a star.�&nbsp;</font></b><b><font face="Arial,Helvetica"></font></b><p><b><font face="Arial,Helvetica">The witness said that the object wasdisregarded at first, but then ten minutes later, it was again noticedstill in the same position. The witness fetched a pair of binoclars.&nbsp;</font></b><b><font face="Arial,Helvetica"></font></b><p><b><font face="Arial,Helvetica">In the binoculars, it looked like oneround light with red flashing in the background, as if there were someother color behind it.&nbsp;</font></b><b><font face="Arial,Helvetica"></font></b><p><b><font face="Arial,Helvetica">This was observed for a duration beforeanother identical object approached and hovered in a vertical line parallelto the existing object. This second object moved in from the northwestand moved at a speed comparable to common air traffic.&nbsp;</font></b><b><font face="Arial,Helvetica"></font></b><p><b><font face="Arial,Helvetica">The two objects looked to be as bigas a pea held at arms length. Nothing was heard, and the witness said thatthey had listened for any indication of sound, but could hear only �silence.�&nbsp;</font></b><b><font face="Arial,Helvetica"></font></b><p><b><font face="Arial,Helvetica">No electrical trouble or animal reactionwas noticed.&nbsp;</font></b><b><font face="Arial,Helvetica"></font></b><p><b><font face="Arial,Helvetica">The two objects held stationary for�a couple of minutes.� The second one hovered as well, beside the first,before it then moved away to the south about 6-inches from the witnessesvantage point. Then, the first object suddenly headed northeast.&nbsp;</font></b><b><font face="Arial,Helvetica"></font></b><p><b><font face="Arial,Helvetica">The witness was in touch with airportby this time after placing a call to the tower to report the objects, andthey had her on hold. She waited awhile and then hung up the phone as theobjects began to move away.&nbsp;</font></b><b><font face="Arial,Helvetica"></font></b><p><b><font face="Arial,Helvetica">As the objects departed, they movedin unison to the northeast. They never came directly overhead, but wereestimated not to be too far from their vantage point.&nbsp;</font></b><b><font face="Arial,Helvetica"></font></b><p><b><font face="Arial,Helvetica">The second object, which moved awaysix-inches, seemed to �double back� and follow the first object, whichdeparted at a rapid pace.&nbsp;</font></b><b><font face="Arial,Helvetica"></font></b><p><b><font face="Arial,Helvetica">As the two objects drew closer to thewitness location while departing, it became more clear that it was notone light, but multiple lights. They were like off-white/yellowish coloredlights in a horizontal pattern. The witness supects the lights were circular�around� the objects. There was still no sound as they drew overhead.&nbsp;</font></b><b><font face="Arial,Helvetica"></font></b><p><b><font face="Arial,Helvetica">Within minutes of the event, all kindsof planes were active in the area headed to the airport.&nbsp;</font></b><b><font face="Arial,Helvetica"></font></b><p><b><font face="Arial,Helvetica">The witness again called the airportback immediately after the sighting and got right through to someone inthe tower. He told her he had a number for an organization she could contactin the morning. He also wanted to take her name &amp; number, but she declined.The witness only asked the tower operator �if they received any calls,�not if there was anything on radar, reported by pilots or any sort of trafficdisruption. They didn�t volunteer any information to her.&nbsp;</font></b><b><font face="Arial,Helvetica"></font></b><p><b><font face="Arial,Helvetica">She had also called WLWT Channel 5 Newsto see if anyone else called, and asked if SKYCAM could have picked upthe objects, and they said they hadn�t heard anything and SKYCAM probablywouldn�t pick up anything that far away and from that side of town. Theydid not refer anyplace else.&nbsp;</font></b><b><font face="Arial,Helvetica"></font></b><p><b><font face="Arial,Helvetica">The following afternoon (Monday, July7), she contacted a reporter with the Cincinnati Enquirer, after the front-pagenews article on UFOs came out. She said she would like to get in touchwith TASK, the organization mentioned in the news article. They then gaveher the correct phone number to call.&nbsp;</font></b><b><font face="Arial,Helvetica"></font></b><p><b><font face="Arial,Helvetica">The witness was made aware of my intentto document the data she was providing, and was also re-read this typedtranscript of our telephone discussion and agreed with its content.&nbsp;</font></b><b><font face="Arial,Helvetica"></font></b><p><b><font face="Arial,Helvetica">Report filed&nbsp;</font></b><br><b><font face="Arial,Helvetica">July 8, 1997&nbsp;</font></b><i><font face="Arial,Helvetica"></font></i><p><hr WIDTH="100%"><i><font face="Arial,Helvetica"></font></i><p><i><font face="Arial,Helvetica">Hovering helicopters may be generatingthese reports, but it seems as if there should be some sound associatedwith the sightings, even if faintly.

It is also an area heavily travelled by airtraffic to the Greater Cincinnati Airport.&nbsp;</font></i><i><font face="Arial,Helvetica"></font></i><p><i><font face="Arial,Helvetica">Vince Sanders, a northern Kentucky residentinquiring into the July 3 event, contacted an employee of DHL air express.According to his contact, the air traffic on July 3 was about three timesthe usual intensity. There were about 50 aircraft from midnight til 5:30am.This traffic was just DHL's, not taking into consideration the increasedtraffic of the other companys operating out of the airport. Sanders wasalso able to confirm this detail with a second contact working for ComAir.&nbsp;</font></i><i><font face="Arial,Helvetica"></font></i><p><i><font face="Arial,Helvetica">Although the witness assures that theobjects observed were not airplanes, the location indicated and time ofreported sighted causes us to consider this UFO report within the 'explained'category due to the high probability of a mundane answer to the claim,and the strength of the explanation.&nbsp;</font></i><i><font face="Arial,Helvetica"></font></i><p><i><font face="Arial,Helvetica">A check with the FAA FLIGHT SERVICESand the Greater Cincinnati Control Tower revealed no additional UFO reportsor traffic disruption had been logged or recorded.&nbsp;</font></i><i><font face="Arial,Helvetica"></font></i><p><i><font face="Arial,Helvetica">On Wednesday, June 18 at 9:00 p.m.,witnesses from two separate areas reported 'falling lights' to 700 WLWNews.

I saw somethingmoving across the sky and I thought was a jet flying at a very high altitude.As I watched the object I realized that I couldn't see any wings. ThenI noticed a second object moving in the same direction, not too far behindthe first. I could not see any wings on the second object either. Bothof these objects were identical. They appeared to be flying very high whereyou would normally see a military jet flying. They resembled a missile,not very long and all white. I could see something orange in color at therear end of these objects. I couldn't tell if the orange piece was partof the object or flames coming from an engine. Both were traveling almostdue north and from my perspective they were about one foot apart (I supposethey could have been one mile apart in reality.) They were moving prettyfast. I first noticed them as they were directly overhead and it took aboutone minute to move out of my line of sight. There were no visible vaportrails or any other evidence that they were there.&nbsp;</font></i><i><font face="Arial,Helvetica"></font></i><p><i><font face="Arial,Helvetica">If I had to guess I would say that theywere missiles, probably on a test run of some sort. They could have beenmilitary jets and due to the altitudes that they were flying I just couldn'tsee the wings.
