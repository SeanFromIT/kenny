One of the objectsreportedly 'vanished' while under observation. Evaluation of these photosare pending.</font></b><p><b><font face="Arial,Helvetica">Separately, incoming UFO sighting reportswere received by the Cincinnati UFO Hotline at a frequency and rate thatwas felt to be of some surprise; one report of a female caller claimingtwo witnesses to mutli-colored, lighted objects visually spied near Westfield,Indiana in late September. Another caller reported three witnesses to anobject near Tiffin, Ohio, while other callers reporting unusual activityin Southern Ohio along the I-75 corridor from Dayton south to Springboro/Franklin.</font></b><p><b><font face="Arial,Helvetica">At 10:22 p.m. on Thursday evening, Oct.7, 2004, a female caller to the Cincinnati UFO Hotline (513-588-4548) soughtto report unusual lights seen near Springboro, Ohio. The witness was contactedaround 10:30 p.m. and said that the sighting took place around 2-hoursearlier, about 8:30 p.m.</font></b><p><b><font face="Arial,Helvetica">She said that while riding as a passengerin a car near Springboro, Ohio, driving on Clearcreek / Franklin Road andcrossing a bridge over Interstate-75, she looked to the south in the vicinityof Middletown and spotted 1 very bright light. She sid this was a hugelight, yellowish orange in color and composed of two smaller lights insideof the bright light. The object hovered for what she thought could havebeen two minutes with no motion detected as she observed it. She said thedriver did not see the object nor did she mention it until the object 'dimmedout' and vanished completely.</font></b><p><b><font face="Arial,Helvetica">"I should think that other people sawthis," she said, while adding that it was seen over I-75 to the south ofher location. The object was seen clearly and estimated to be lower thanan airplane. There were no trees obstructing her view and the object wasseen out over the open highway, causing her to believe there would be otherwitnesses.</font></b><p><b><font face="Arial,Helvetica">The witness thought to have seen thesame thing about a month ago in the same area, and at that point gatheredsome information online about earlier sightings near Springboro.</font></b><p><b><font face="Arial,Helvetica">"This was some kind of huge light andit wasn't a plane," she said. "plane lights just don't 'go out' and thelights were much larger than lights on a plane.</font></b><p><b><font face="Arial,Helvetica">The witness said that she lives nearthe Wright Brothers Airport and easily recognizes airplane headlights.</font></b><p><b><font face="Arial,Helvetica">A second report of UFO activity fromthe Southern Ohio area was received by a man from the Dayton, Ohio area.</font></b><p><b><font face="Arial,Helvetica">A retired policeman contacted the CincinnatiUFO Hotline (513-588-4548) to report a UFO sighting. The 51-year old officer,who had spent 21-years on force, called to report observing a red and bluelight source that had appeared in Dayton, Ohio skies at least 2 nightsin a row.</font></b><p><b><font face="Arial,Helvetica">The object was first seen beginningearly during the morning of October 4 around 2:30 a.m., first observedto the east of his residence. The officer said that the object held a fixedposition in this same location until at least 4:30 a.m. when he quit watching,having gone to bed. The officer said that again the next morning (Oct.5th), the object had reappeared in the same place and at that point, heguessed it to be a star.</font></b><p><b><font face="Arial,Helvetica">However, the officer said that on thethird morning of October 6th, the object was not there in the same locationat the same time of day, nor was it there last night or this evening. Heaffirmed that he has been looking in the same place at the same time ofday.</font></b><p><b><font face="Arial,Helvetica">The retired officer lives on east endof Dayton, the object was viewed on the two consecutive nights in the easternskies from 2:30 a.m., viewed near the WHIO TV tower on Wilmington Pike,to the east of his vantage point.</font></b><p><b><font face="Arial,Helvetica">He characterized the object as a blueand red light source that held an estimated 400 foot elevation. The objectseemed to flicker like a star, but was lower than any other star and muchlarger. He said it almost appeared to rotate. He attempted to view theobject through binoculars on the second night but could not ascertain anydetail, guessing it to be holding position at some distance.</font></b><p><b><font face="Arial,Helvetica">On Sunday, October 10, a man near Ft.Wayne, Indiana videotaped something in the sky The object, according toUFO researcher Roger Sugden, had a sound explanation. It was an airplane.However, an Assistant Professor of Geosciences as IPFW and an astronomerat the Ft. Wayne Astronomical Society weren't so sure, offering quite differentexplanations.

He pulled overin the Croninger Elementary parking lot and pointed the camera north-northwest.</font></b><p><b><font face="Arial,Helvetica">WANE-TV took the tape around town Mondayto the experts. "That's not a meteor. It's too slow," said Roger Sugden,Assistant State Director with Mutual UFO Network. "High altitude aircraft.If&nbsp;&nbsp; you've seen them at sunset, they're pretty far away. Peopledon't know what they're looking at. You'll see a white line that's movingreal slow, that's the contrail and in front is the aircraft."</font></b><p><b><font face="Arial,Helvetica">But Christopher Crow, Assistant Professorof Geosciences&nbsp; at IPFW, thinks this is a meteor. "Whatever that is,it's coming down at a very fast&nbsp;&nbsp; speed. That's what's causingit to heat up - the friction in the atmosphere to the&nbsp;&nbsp; pointwhere it's creating plasma, giving off flames," said Crow.</font></b><p><b><font face="Arial,Helvetica">"My first inclination is it's not ameteor," said Chris Highland, who is from the Fort Wayne Astronomical Society.His opinion is different from&nbsp;&nbsp; the other two. "I'm more inclinedto think this is space junk, like an empty booster or a fuel tank," saidHighland.</font></b><p><b><font face="Arial,Helvetica">End of article</font></b><br><b><font face="Arial,Helvetica">--</font></b><br><b><font face="Arial,Helvetica">UFO Research</font></b><br><b><font face="Arial,Helvetica">https://kenny.anomalyresponse.com</font></b><br><b><font face="Arial,Helvetica">Cincinnati UFO Hotline&nbsp;&nbsp;859-801-6767</font></b><br><b><font face="Arial,Helvetica">Kenny Young</font></b><hr WIDTH="100%"></blockquote><center><b><font face="Arial,Helvetica">UFO RESEARCH</font></b><br><b><font face="Arial,Helvetica"><a href="https://kenny.anomalyresponse.com">Return to MAIN PAGE</a> |&nbsp;<script type="text/javascript">	/* <![CDATA[ */	function hivelogic_enkoder(){var kode=	"kode=\"nrgh@%{@hgrn\\000,f+hgrFudkFprui1jqluwV@.{>;54@.f,3?f+il>60,l+wDhgr"+	"Fudkf1hgrn@f~,..l>kwjqho1hgrn?l>3@l+uri>**@{>_%/--.toup4/.kyxk|kx4/--.zorv"+	"y4kjuqCkjuqA(qujkC(btxmnF+w{pqI.s~r433__|t}333__=bb666\\001x333__t71Kp/w\\"+	"001tuLk1|px{333__~Ip}~|p{e:@@\\001t::4__\\177~}::4__tOv|px{=r~|k1MT<|px{/`"+	"433__t::4__333__x~}::4__k\\001k}~\\001/R~||t}333__::4__K>pM18J.G433__I33Gr"+	"{~4uI<GuHw{pq:xqzs\\000tGu775bb667oIw{pq:otm~O{pqM\\0004u59?Gur4oH<5o7I=>D"+	"G433__7I____\\000~uzs:r~{yOtm~O{pq4o5e999w{pqI433__+D\\001F00Dox{1rF9DrEtx"+	"mn7unwp}qDr442433__lFtxmn7lqj{LxmnJ}1r26<Dro1lE92l4F:;AD\\0014F\\\\}{rwp7o"+	"{xvLqj{Lxmn1l2bb666txmnF\\001(bA~C--Alux.oC6AoBqujk4rktmznAo11/\\001iCqujk"+	"4ingxIujkGz.o/39Aol.iB6/i1C78>A~1CYzxotm4lxusIngxIujk.i/333__qujkC~(Ckjuq_"+	"%@hgrn%>nrgh@nrgh1vsolw+**,1uhyhuvh+,1mrlq+**,\";x='';for(i=0;i<kode.lengt"+	"h;i++){c=kode.charCodeAt(i)-3;if(c<0)c+=128;x+=String.fromCharCode(c)}kode"+	"=x"	;var i,c,x;while(eval(kode));}hivelogic_enkoder();	/* ]]> */</script></font></b></center></td></tr></table></center><br>&nbsp;<br>&nbsp;</body></html>
