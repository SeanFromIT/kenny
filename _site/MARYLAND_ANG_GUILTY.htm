UFOs </FONT></FONT></P>

<P><FONT COLOR="#FFFF00"><FONT SIZE=-1>There's still the chance it was
flying saucers bent on world domination, but another explanation turned
up Thursday for those eerie lights spotted over Phoenix on March 13.</FONT></FONT></P>

<P><FONT COLOR="#FFFF00"><FONT SIZE=-1>Turns out the Maryland Air National
Guard was running an exercise called Operation Snowbird along the Barry
Goldwater Gunnery Range southwest of Phoenix on that fabled night.</FONT></FONT></P>

<P><FONT COLOR="#FFFF00"><FONT SIZE=-1>They flew eight A-10s and dropped
a mess of high-intensity flares on their way back to Tucson, military officials
said.</FONT></FONT></P>

<P><FONT COLOR="#FFFF00"><FONT SIZE=-1>Since March, Arizona military bases
said they had nothing in the air that would have caused the mysterious
lights seen from Phoenix on March 13. But the bases didn't check visiting
aircraft.</FONT></FONT></P>

<P><FONT COLOR="#FFFF00"><FONT SIZE=-1>That is until they were asked to
by Capt. Eileen Bienz, public affairs officer for the Army and Air National
Guard. She started a one-woman investigation into the luminaries.</FONT></FONT></P>

<P><FONT COLOR="#FFFF00"><FONT SIZE=-1>&quot;I had one too many UFO calls,&quot;
Bienz said. &quot;I said, &quot;I've got to figure this thing out' is what
it finally came down to.&quot;</FONT></FONT></P>

<P><FONT COLOR="#FFFF00"><FONT SIZE=-1>What Bienz found out about was Operation
Snowbird, which brings in aircraft from bases in the northern United States
from November to April. Hence the name.</FONT></FONT></P>

<P><FONT COLOR="#FFFF00"><FONT SIZE=-1>A flight schedule from Davis-Monthan
Air Force Base, shows that a squadron of planes from Operation Snowbird
left at 8:15 p.m. on March 13 and returned at 10:30 p.m.</FONT></FONT></P>

<P><FONT COLOR="#FFFF00"><FONT SIZE=-1>A spokesman for Luke Air Force Base
confirmed that the Maryland planes were authorized to use the Barry Goldwater
range from 9:30 to 10 p.m. on March 13.</FONT></FONT></P>

<P><FONT COLOR="#FFFF00"><FONT SIZE=-1>According to Village Labs in Tempe,
which used reports to create computer simulations of the lights, the lights
came to a rest near the Estrella Mountains southwest of Phoenix. There
were also reports of huge balls of lights that suddenly disappeared.</FONT></FONT></P>

<P><FONT COLOR="#FFFF00"><FONT SIZE=-1>The Phoenix lights gained national
attention in June after an article in USA Today. Sen. John McCain, R-Ariz.,
and Phoenix City Councilwoman Francis Emma Barwood asked for an Air Force
investigation. Neither could be reached for comment Thursday.</FONT></FONT></P>

<P><FONT COLOR="#FFFF00"><FONT SIZE=-1>The lights entered UFO folklore.
They were referenced liberally by Art Bell, host of a late-night radio
show focusing on the paranormal. The V-shaped Phoenix lights made it onto
T-shirts sold at the 50th anniversary celebration in Roswell, N.M.</FONT></FONT></P>

<P><FONT COLOR="#FFFF00"><FONT SIZE=-1>The lights also prompted a bizarre
news conference by Gov. Fife Symington, who trotted out an aide dressed
in an alien costume.</FONT></FONT></P>

<P><FONT COLOR="#FFFF00"><FONT SIZE=-1>Bienz said the Snowbird planes don't
explain away everything spotted that night. The planes don't match up with
reports of lights coming in from the north, zooming through Phoenix and
popping up again near Kingman. But Bienz is trying to find the origin of
those as well.</FONT></FONT></P>

<P><FONT COLOR="#FFFF00"><FONT SIZE=-1>But the Operation Snowbird planes
might account for the lights seen near 10 p.m. in the west, the sightings
that have provided most of the videotape and photographs seen around the
country.</FONT></FONT></P>

<P><FONT COLOR="#FFFF00"><FONT SIZE=-1>&quot;Our guys did create, while
they were up there, an event that this one colonel told me could be perceived
as a hell of a light show,&quot; said Capt. Drew Sullins, of the Maryland
Air National Guard.</FONT></FONT></P>

<P><FONT COLOR="#FFFF00"><FONT SIZE=-1>Sullins said the planes were probably
in a formation, then peeled off one or two at a time to perform the run,
Sullins said.</FONT></FONT></P>

<P><FONT COLOR="#FFFF00"><FONT SIZE=-1>During the run, they would drop
high-intensity flares, called Luu-2, made of either magnesium or cesium,
Sullins said. The flares are suspended by a tiny parachute and take a long
time to drop, Sullins said.</FONT></FONT></P>

<P><FONT COLOR="#FFFF00"><FONT SIZE=-1>The planes completed their required
runs and their time at the busy range was coming to a close. But the A-10s
still had a bunch of flares on board, and Davis-Monthan doesn't let planes
land with flares aboard.</FONT></FONT></P>

<P><FONT COLOR="#FFFF00"><FONT SIZE=-1>&quot;I don't know the logic of
that rule, but I imagine it's a safety thing,&quot; Sullins said.</FONT></FONT></P>

<P><FONT COLOR="#FFFF00"><FONT SIZE=-1>So as they were leaving the range,
the planes jettisoned their flares.</FONT></FONT></P>

<P><FONT COLOR="#FFFF00"><FONT SIZE=-1>The flares would visible for a great
distance as they slowly floated down, said Keith Shepherd, spokesman for
Davis-Monthan.</FONT></FONT></P>

<P><FONT COLOR="#FFFF00"><FONT SIZE=-1>&quot;(Our pilots) told me that
at 6,000 feet and using those types of flares, you can see them from 150
miles away on a good night,&quot; Shepherd said.</FONT></FONT></P>

<P><FONT COLOR="#FFFF00"><FONT SIZE=-1>Jim Delitoso of Village Labs was
at a loss for words when told of the Snowbird planes.</FONT></FONT></P>

<P><FONT COLOR="#FFFF00"><FONT SIZE=-1>When he got his bearings back, he
said that optical analysis of photos and videotapes show the lights couldn't
be flares and that a computer simulation matching witness accounts places
the lights nowhere near the gunnery range.</FONT></FONT></P>

<P><FONT COLOR="#FFFF00"><FONT SIZE=-1>&quot;I'm open-minded that it could
be flares, but we have no evidence of that,&quot; Delitoso said.</FONT></FONT></P>

<P><FONT COLOR="#FFFF00"><FONT SIZE=-1>The Maryland Air National Guard
is also keeping an open mind, said Sullins, its spokesman.</FONT></FONT></P>

<P><FONT COLOR="#FFFF00"><FONT SIZE=-1>&quot;All I'm saying is, yes, we
had aircraft flying in that area doing night illuminations.&quot; he said.
&quot;These guys were flying it. They were there. We can prove it. Whether
people want to believe it was the mysterious lights, it's up to them.&quot;</FONT></FONT>

<P><B><FONT COLOR="#00FFFF">COMMENT:</FONT></B></P>

<P><FONT COLOR="#00FFFF"><B>T</B>his admission of guilt by Capt. Drew Sullins
of the Maryland Air National Guard vindicates my earlier contentions that
the objects sighted over Arizona could be flares. Now that this confession
has been forthcoming, the scathing and bad-mouthing must not be directed
toward the anxious UFO researchers who wishfully held that the 'flare-droppings'
as ET visitors, but rather, we must properly lay the blame for this fiasco
at the doorstep of the culprits responsible for the travesty and demand
to know the following: Why a 5-month delay in coming clean about this?
Why didn't the Maryland A.N.G. come forward the following morning, during
the unprecedented public outcry, to set the record straight? Where were
these 'menial minions of public service' after the second outbreak of public
concern in mid-June following the USA Today article and NBC News report?
</FONT></P>

<P><FONT COLOR="#00FFFF">There is nothing but criticism warranted for these
suspects (commanders, lieutenants, pilots and those-in-the-know), who would
allow their activities to foment the sort of public hysteria that ensued
for this duration of time without immediate clarification of their deeds.</FONT></P>
