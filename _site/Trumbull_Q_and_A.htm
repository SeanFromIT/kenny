Disturbance?</FONT> </FONT></I></LI>
</UL>

<P><FONT COLOR="#FFFF00"><FONT SIZE=-1>This incident is a remarkable UFO
situation happening in 1994 near Youngstown, Ohio. The case involved the
pursuit of a low-flying object by numerous police officials from a wide
area. One officer approached the object at close range, saying it 'lit
up the ground as if daylight,' and also declared that the electronic/radio
instrumentation of his patrol cruiser was &quot;shut down&quot; by the
object. </FONT></FONT></P>

<P><I><FONT COLOR="#FFFF00"><FONT SIZE=+1>Why hasn't this been publicized?</FONT></FONT></I></P>

<P><FONT COLOR="#FFFF00"><FONT SIZE=-1>That question is partly what makes
this case somewhat interesting. The details of this incident had been known
by and available to news media personnel in the region, but the incredible
story was never publicized, and the participants involved did not seek
to discuss the incident in any public capacity. The case was discovered
by accident as a misplaced phone call by a UFO researcher was directed
to the wrong police agency concerning a separate UFO sighting in a small
town in southern Ohio. </FONT></FONT></P>

<UL>
<LI><I><FONT COLOR="#FFFF00"><FONT SIZE=+1>When did this happen?</FONT></FONT></I></LI>
</UL>

<P><FONT COLOR="#FFFF00"><FONT SIZE=-1>The incident actually began before
12:01 a.m. in the early morning hours of Wednesday, December 14, 1994.
Before midnight, the Trumbull County 9-1-1 center had already logged several
UFO reports from residents near the Sampson Road vicinity. Curiously, UFOs
were reported in the area the previous evening, as well as two weeks prior.</FONT></FONT></P>

<UL>
<LI><I><FONT COLOR="#FFFF00"><FONT SIZE=+1>Where, exactly, did this occur?</FONT></FONT></I></LI>

</UL>

<P><FONT COLOR="#FFFF00"><FONT SIZE=-1>In an area within Liberty Township,
about 4-miles north of Youngstown, surrounded by Weathersfield Township
to the west, Vienna Township to the north and Hubbard Township to the east.
The happening occurred near and above the Youngstown Air Reserve Station,
where public relations officers adamently deny the event ever transpired,
despite the acquisition of 9-1-1 police dispatch tapes to the contrary.</FONT></FONT></P>

<UL>
<LI><I><FONT COLOR="#FFFF00"><FONT SIZE=+1>How were the 9-1-1 tapes acquired?</FONT></FONT></I></LI>
</UL>

<P><FONT COLOR="#FFFF00"><FONT SIZE=-1>Several telecommunicators at the
Trumbull County 9-1-1 center read the 1996 report entitled:&nbsp;&quot;The
Trumbull County Disturbance: The Wrong Liberty,&quot; which appeared on
the internet. Intruiged by this account, they researched the case and acquired
a date of the event. Acting strictly as private citizens and not on behalf
of the department, they retrieved the data from the audio tapes stored
at the center. The original tapes were said to have been 'missing,' but
a backup set was located in another storage area.</FONT></FONT></P>

<UL>

<LI><I><FONT COLOR="#FFFF00"><FONT SIZE=+1>Which police departments are
involved?</FONT></FONT></I></LI>
</UL>

<P><FONT COLOR="#FFFF00"><FONT SIZE=-1>There are 25 police departments
in the Trumbull County area, all of which are serviced by the same 9-1-1
Telecommunications Center. A dispatcher on the December 14, 1994 audio
tape acquired from the 9-1-1 telecommunications center stated that the
UFO was observed by numerous police agencies. There are two references
to this. One quote: <I>&quot;Everyone in the county has a visual on it
that I can hear.&quot;</I> Another controller states: <I>&quot;We have
multiple departments right now that has sightings on it.&quot;</I></FONT></FONT></P>

</UL>

<P><FONT COLOR="#FFFF00"><FONT SIZE=-1>Note that this listing excludes
one major department: The Trumbull County Highway Patrol, which is totally
separate and not dispatched by the 9-1-1 center. This agency does not retain
9-1-1 tapes from December of 1994.</FONT></FONT></P>

<UL>
<LI><I><FONT COLOR="#FFFF00"><FONT SIZE=+1>What about the Airbase?</FONT></FONT></I></LI>
</UL>

<P><FONT COLOR="#FFFF00"><FONT SIZE=-1>There is one facility 'SHARED' by
both the Youngstown/Warren Regioal Airport and the Youngstown Air Force
Reserve Station. From various interviews, it has been determined that the
UFO seen by the police officers and base-security personnel would/should
have been observed by the FAA controller in the radar tower, which was
situated at a nearly 60-foot elevation. On the 9-1-1 tapes, the controller
informs that he cannot visually observe the object, and adds that his radar
screens indicates no traffic in the area. The Ohio Atlas &amp; Gazetteer
by Delorme illustrates 4- runway/taxiways. The facility is situated near
the Crown Hill cemetary (also referenced in tape). The airport is north
of Warren Sharon Road, east of Ridge Road, west of Route 193 and south
of Kings Graves Road. The airport is about five miles east of Warren. The
region in question is adjacent to a Defense Logistics Agency and National
Defense Stockpile, one of the biggest radar/air defense installations in
the United States. The Youngstown Municipal Radar Air Defense Agency is
also within the locality. </FONT></FONT></P>

<P><FONT COLOR="#FFFF00"><FONT SIZE=-1>&quot;Most people don't realize
that this air base out here is one of the best kept secrets in the whole
damnable country,&quot; a Hubbard police officer stated in 1996. &quot;Don't
kid yourself. You wouldn't believe the hardware,&quot; he insisted.</FONT></FONT></P>

<UL>
<LI><I><FONT COLOR="#FFFF00"><FONT SIZE=+1>What was described?</FONT></FONT></I></LI>
</UL>

<P><FONT COLOR="#FFFF00"><FONT SIZE=-1>Various descriptions are given to
recount the physical appearance of the object, ranging from a bright light
to a structured object with a parachute-like attachment, to an object with
an element protruding from the top of it. The primary object was first
said to have been 'blue-colored' and even described as the &quot;back-end
of a fighter plane.&quot; Other callers described a bluish-green object
with flames. Police officers described a brilliant red light on a 'huge'
object, others reported a bright-white light. Still others described a
glowing red, saucer-shaped object which rotated, as if on an axis. </FONT></FONT></P>

<P><FONT COLOR="#FFFF00"><FONT SIZE=-1>No sound was heard in conjunction
with any of the sightings. </FONT></FONT></P>

<P><FONT COLOR="#FFFF00"><FONT SIZE=-1>As the event progressed, at least
two objects were seen and pursued. Three or more objects were also reported
at a higher altitude before military jets were thought to have arrived,
in pursuit of the UFOs. There is no indication (on the 9-1-1 tape) that
the primary object was seen to produce or generate the other objects (a
commonly reported characteristic of many UFO reports), and such a happening
would have probably been referenced by the policemen without reservation
due to the mass-witness climate. If other objects were truly present and
visibly noticed in divergent locations, their approach method is not known
(zoom, swing, fade in, etc). From the tape, we know that the initial object
approached from a high elevation and hovered at an estimated 50-foot elevation
sometime before midnight above a residential neighborhood for a lengthy
duration before executing a departure path to the north, finally rising
to a high elevation and appearing as a star in the sky.</FONT></FONT></P>

<P><FONT COLOR="#FFFF00"><FONT SIZE=-1>To balance this account, one must
also note the possibility that the excited and alert officers could have
been observing and misidentifying stars or airplanes while on the lookout
for a UFO reported across the county by several of their fellow officers.
This is even referenced on the tape as speculation by other policemen who
apparently did not see the main object. However, it should be stressed
that an officer on the tape did qualify a distinct difference between stars
and routine air traffic against the unknown objects, which he counted to
be as many as six. He made the analysis while speaking to the controller
as he was visibly observing the objects. Another officer flatly discounted
the 'star or planet' scenario, stating that the object was 'huge' and lit
up the ground as if it were daylight.</FONT></FONT></P>

<UL>
<LI><I><FONT COLOR="#FFFF00"><FONT SIZE=+1>Is there any record of whether
jets were scrambled that night? If they were (as the police officer indicated,
&quot;four planes up there&quot;) would that be very unusual at, say, 2
a.m.?</FONT></FONT></I></LI>
</UL>

<P><FONT COLOR="#FFFF00"><FONT SIZE=-1>We don't know that 2 A.M. was the
approximate time of this report, we are given no time-stamp or reference
point from which to accurately log the event. The officers who dubbed the
tape from the master reel gleaned the data from a time period after midnight
until 6:00 a.m. The segment referencing the 'military jets' is one of the
final sequences, so it could have been later in the morning, perhaps 4
or as late as 5. Since this data is retained within a 6-hour time, the
'real-time' impressions upon listening to the available recording will
not be reflected, as its duration has been compacted onto a 90-minute tape.
The officer who is observing the jets is doing so from a time-frame where
the incident is nearly over.</FONT></FONT></P>

<P><FONT COLOR="#FFFF00"><FONT SIZE=-1>One may suspect the presence of
jets at an early hour would be unusual, but note that the officer involved
certainly thought that the airbase was scrambling jets in pursuit. The
Public Relations Officer at the Youngstown Air Force Reserve Station, who
denies the reality of the event, informs that no jet aircraft as described
are housed at the facility, where C-130 Cargo planes are stationed. If
jets were, indeed scrambled to the scene, they may have originated from
the Springfield, Ohio Air National Guard Base or Wright-Patterson Air Force
Base in Dayton, Ohio. It is very reasonable to suspect that if jets were,
in fact, scrambled... they could have originated from another state altogether.
</FONT></FONT></P>

<P><FONT COLOR="#FFFF00"><FONT SIZE=-1>It is important to note that when
the Liberty Twp. dispatcher contacted the FAA tower operator (around the
1 A.M. time-frame), the radar controller said there was nothing on radar
or in the air at the time within a 60-mile radius of Youngstown. He added
that a plane had departed about 30-minutes earlier and climbed straight
up, but nothing was 'presently' around. This indicates the arrival of the
alleged jets were probably within a fair amount of time after the analysis
by the radar operator. </FONT></FONT></P>

<P><FONT COLOR="#FFFF00"><FONT SIZE=-1>Another factor in this may also
be the pattern of scheduled military or commercial flights in/from Youngstown
during the early morning hours. Perhaps as the morning progressed, more
air traffic increased (such as Federal Express, etc). However, in an interview
with base personnel and a local officer from the area, he informed that
there are no routine flights in or out of the facility.</FONT></FONT></P>

<UL>
<LI><I><FONT COLOR="#FFFF00"><FONT SIZE=+1>What about the air traffic controller.
Had he/they been &quot;fired&quot; or &quot;reassigned?&quot;</FONT></FONT></I></LI>
</UL>

<P><FONT COLOR="#FFFF00"><FONT SIZE=-1>Unknown. A news reporter with a
Youngstown television station was aware of rumors that the controllers
who had been employed at the tower in the time-frame surrounding this incident
had been reassigned across the country. Despite FOIA requests asking for
such information, nothing has been advanced to shed light on this aspect
of the story. During a 1996 interview with a tower supervisor, it was stated
that all of the controllers were FIRED at roughly the same time.These comments,
from a female operative, were within the context of the UFO inquiry and
in direct response to questions regarding their whereabouts. There was,
however, no indication of wrongdoing (as the term implies) given that would
justify their dismissal. (Such an admission would probably not have been
furnished anyway). </FONT></FONT></P>

<P><FONT COLOR="#FFFF00"><FONT SIZE=-1>Without any direct information equating
this collective dismissal/firing with the UFO incident, it may important
to reference. The needfulness of this reference can be drawn from the Michigan
9-1-1 situation - also from '94, where it was reported that the radar operator
involved in that case was somewhat elusive when researchers sought to contact
him, as he, too, had been reassigned elsewhere. A similar case of 'reassignment'
is the Eastlake County, Ohio case from the late '80s in which U.S. Coast
Guard employees witnessed a spectacular UFO and afterward could not be
located by reporters due to their relocation and new duties. This establishes
certain precedent from which soft reference (and concern) can be justified.
</FONT></FONT></P>

<P><FONT COLOR="#FFFF00"><FONT SIZE=-1>At this point and from the information
afforded on the tapes, we only know of one FAA tower operator who responded
to the calls from the 9-1-1 center. It is not known if this one person
was numbered among those who were 'fired.'</FONT></FONT><BR>
</P>

<UL>
<LI><I><FONT COLOR="#FFFF00"><FONT SIZE=+1>What attempts have been made
to explain this incident?</FONT></FONT></I></LI>
</UL>

<P><FONT COLOR="#FFFF00"><FONT SIZE=-1>Numerous inquiries have been made
with officials of the Youngstown Air Reserve Station, as well as police
departments, and one local hospital in the region, to determine if this
could be a case of mistaken identity caused by other air traffic. Various
avenues of approach considered that an emergency medical helicopter or
a low flying 'Sky-Crane' helicopter could have generated the reports. After
detailed investigation, however, such speculation has been satisfactorally
discounted.</FONT></FONT></P>

<UL>

<LI><I><FONT COLOR="#FFFF00"><FONT SIZE=+1>What next?</FONT></FONT></I></LI>
</UL>

<P><FONT COLOR="#FFFF00"><FONT SIZE=-1>Numerous FOIA requests and responses
are still pending, and additional channels of inquiry are also being sought.
There are &quot;certain rumblings&quot; indicating that the Trumbull County
Disturbance may be referenced in a national news program, which is currently
in production. Continued investigations into this affair may still yield
more clues, and further technical means are being explored so that the
9-1-1 tapes can be made available to the internet patron. </FONT></FONT></P>
