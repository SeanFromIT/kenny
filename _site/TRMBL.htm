</ul>
<font color="#FFFF00"><font size=-1>It can be demonstrated that police
departments across Ohio and other states are more reluctant than ever to
associate their departments or officers with alleged UFO occurrences, and
understandably so. Those armed with the "badge of truth" do not usually
relish their position as the 'middleman' between the U.S. Air Force and
the UFO phenomenon.</font></font>
<p><font color="#FFFF00"><font size=-1>"From my information, calls placed
from police departments to Wright-Patterson Air Force Base are forwarded
directly to secret offices at the air base that are solely responsible
for monitoring the UFO situation," charges George Clappison, UFO researcher
and investigator.</font></font>
<ul>

<li>
<b><font color="#FFFF00"><font size=-1>THE MYSTERY TATTLER</font></font></b></li>
</ul>
<font color="#FFFF00"><font size=-1>To bolster his contention, Clappison
cites a 1995 source he identifies only as <i>"a southern Ohio law enforcement
official." </i>After several confidential, tightly controlled meetings
with his source, Clappison was informed that his contact had a UFO sighting
while on-duty about ten years prior. His dispatch office then alerted the
air base of the occurrence. The officer recalled that within days of the
event, he was <u>visited and questioned by several agents from the Cincinnati
offices of the FBI.</u></font></font>
<p><font color="#FFFF00"><font size=-1>The law enforcement official conveyed
to Clappison his belief that the Air Force and various intelligence communities
<i>currently
monitor and investigate the UFO situation</i>, despite public denials.
According to the opinion of the informant, the U.S. Air Force
<b><i>monitors
and utilizes the vast resources of police dispatch centers for the collection
of UFO reports.</i></b></font></font>

</ul>
<font color="#FFFF00"><font size=-1>Even when reporting a UFO directly
to the Dayton, Ohio, air base, a phone receptionist taking the call will
politely refer the caller to <i>"report the incident to your local police
department."</i></font><font size=-2> <a href="#1">1</a></font></font>
<p><font color="#FFFF00"><font size=-1>It is known that certain air emergency
situations are held under the authority of the State Patrol for handling
and disposition, and as the Air Force position illustrates, this authority
also extends to the State Patrol for response and investigation of UFO
reports.&nbsp;&nbsp;<a href="#2"> </a></font><font size=-2><a href="#2">2</a></font></font>
<p><font color="#FFFF00"><font size=-1>One should also consider the curious
existence of the strange <u>"SIGNAL 50"</u> code word utilized by The Ohio
State Highway Patrol during radio communications to announce the observation
of unknown aircraft.&nbsp;&nbsp; </font><font size=-2><a href="#3">3</a></font></font>

<li>
<b><font color="#FFFF00"><font size=-1>Reporting procedures and the LeCI
incident</font></font></b></li>
</ul>
<font color="#FFFF00"><font size=-1>A heated UFO incident at the Lebanon
Correctional Institute occurred on April 8, 1993 in Warren County, Ohio,
in which a glowing red object hovered for nearly three hours over a state
penitentiary. The Warren County Sheriff's Department and the Ohio State
Highway Patrol responded to the multiple witness event, and calls were
placed by the dispatch office to Wright-Patterson Air Force Base in Dayton,
requesting aircraft identification.&nbsp;<a href="#4"> </a></font><font size=-2><a href="#4">4</a></font></font>
<p><font color="#FFFF00"><font size=-1>Wright-Pat denied having any experimental
aircraft in the vicinity, and furthermore stated that they had no radar
track of the unknown object, which, according to a statement given by Commander
H. Lake of the adjacent Warren Correctional Institute, was "presented to
the Warren County Sheriff's Department by his shift supervisor upon their
arrival."</font></font>
<p><font color="#FFFF00"><font size=-1>Despite denials by the LeCI or WCI
prison offices and the Ohio Department of Corrections and Rehabilitation
that any internal documentation of the event exists, H. Lake stated emphatically,
"I don't know what they're talking about. A report does exist because I
wrote the report myself."&nbsp; </font><font size=-2><a href="#5">5</a></font></font>
<p><font color="#FFFF00"><font size=-1>Presently , public relations officials
at Wright-Patt contend that they have no documentation available regarding
any incoming calls from the Ohio State Highway Patrol regarding the April
8, 1993 UFO incident at LeCI. However, FOIA Manager Paul Cassidy stated
that <i>"if a phone call was indeed made to this base, there should be
SOME kind of documentation SOMEWHERE, whether it be in the form of a log
entry or scribbled notes."</i>&nbsp;<a href="#6"> </a></font><font size=-2><a href="#6">6</a></font></font>

<p><font color="#FFFF00"><font size=-1>To the contrary of WPAFB public
relations department, O.S.P. log entries acquired by UFO investigators
revealed that<i> several calls</i> were indeed placed to the Dayton, Ohio,
air base. Dispatchers at the Ohio State Patrol and Warren County Sheriff?s
Office even confirmed that Wright-Patt had been alerted by utilizing a
<u>special,
confidential phone number </u>that gives them direct access to the high-tech
air base. When asked for the number to be released to researchers, each
respective office refused to disclose it, saying it was a restricted line,
and <u>not releasable to the public.</u>&nbsp;</font><font size=-2> <a href="#7">7</a></font></font>
<p><font color="#FFFF00"><font size=-1>It can be said with certainty that
this writer did hear and detect abnormal aircraft activity above the Cincinnati
region in the form of jet engine sounds which were heard constantly from
around 4:15 A.M. until daybreak on the night of the incident. The jet sounds
were deep and powerful, unlike common air traffic heard frequently above
Cincinnati. Not until the evening news later that day did this writer learn
of the events at the Lebanon, Ohio, prison, upon which time the heavy droning
sound of the jet noise was recalled.</font></font>
<ul>
<li>
<b><font color="#FFFF00"><font size=-1>Event from the past...</font></font></b></li>

</ul>
<font color="#FFFF00"><font size=-1>There is a healthy historical precedent
for UFO mix-ups between Ohio police agencies and UFOs, with the U.S. Air
Force always having a distant and uncertain role in the drama.</font></font>
<p><font color="#FFFF00"><font size=-1>Case in point: at 4:50 A.M. on April
17, 1966, two sheriff?s deputies, <i>Dale Spaur</i> and <i>Wilber L. Neff,</i>
were advised by the Portage County, Ohio, Dispatch Center to investigate
a low-flying UFO reportedly headed in their direction. The twosome watched
as the glowing object approached their position, illuminating the roadside.&nbsp;
</font><font size=-2><a href="#8">8</a></font></font>
<p><font color="#FFFF00"><font size=-1>"It?s about fifty feet across, and
I can just make out a dome or something on the top, but that?s very dark,"
Spaur yelled into his microphone. "The bottom is real bright, it?s putting
out a beam of light that makes a big spot underneath. It was overhead a
minute ago, and it was as bright as day here."</font></font>
<p><font color="#FFFF00"><font size=-1>The dispatcher advised Spaur and
Neff to keep the UFO in sight, as a car with camera equipment had been
sent out. Soon, the twosome were racing along Route 14 at ninety miles
per hour.</font></font>

<p><font color="#FFFF00"><font size=-1>Other police officers soon joined
the chase. Wayne Huston of East Palestine, Ohio, witnessed the UFO pass
his location at more than 80 miles per hour, and also joined the chase.
"It was a funny thing," he later said, "but when the object got too far
ahead of us it appeared to stop and wait."&nbsp;</font></font><img SRC="patcarfl.gif" height=93 width=209 align=LEFT>
<p><font color="#FFFF00"><font size=-1>One police officer later recalled
that he had seen two jet-fighter aircraft being followed by a bright object
shaped like a football. The vehicular pursuit took multiple police officials
on an eighty-five mile journey into Pennsylvania before the object allegedly
shot off at great speed and disappeared.</font></font>
<p><font color="#FFFF00"><font size=-1>Radar Operators at the Pittsburgh
airport control tower advised the Conway Police Department that they had
picked up the UFO on their radar screens, <i><u>but later denied this.</u></i></font></font>
<p><font color="#FFFF00"><font size=-1>Police chief Gerald Buchert of Mantua,
Ohio, claimed that he photographed the object, but was told by the United
States Air Force not to make the pictures public.</font></font>
<p><font color="#FFFF00"><font size=-1>The official Air Force conclusion
was that Spaur and the others had been chasing the planet Venus.</font></font>
<p><font color="#FFFF00"><font size=-1>Months after the drama, Deputy Spaur
was found in hiding by a reporter. Working as a painter, Spaur lived in
poverty residing at a seedy motel. He had resigned from the police force,
and had been divorced from his wife. "If I could change all that I have
done in my life," he said, <i>"I would change that night we chased that
damned saucer."</i></font></font>
<p><font color="#FFFF00"><font size=-1>Given the sad but true public belittlement
of UFO witnesses by the Air Force, the news media and the debunking celebrities,
it is understandable why police officials such as those involved in the
LeCI Incident and the Portage pursuit are reluctant to talk about their
full knowledge of these events.</font></font>
<ul>

<li>
<b><font color="#FFFF00"><font size=-1>Trumbull County: The Investigation
Begins</font></font></b></li>
</ul>
<font color="#FFFF00"><font size=-1>Startling details regarding police
department involvement in UFO sightings surfaced during a routine investigation
into an alleged "UFO crash retrieval" from Ohio. But the findings were
surprisingly unrelated to the initial event being investigated.</font></font>
<p><font color="#FFFF00"><font size=-1>Inquiries were being made into a
December 26, 1988 UFO incident, happening in an area near Liberty, Ohio,
north of Dayton (not far from Urbana). According to the legend, the Assistant
Chief of Police observed a gigantic, lime-green ball of light change color
as it emerged from the clouds overhead to slam into the ground. Wright-Patterson
Air Force Base was notified of the incident by the dispatch office, and
allegedly sent out a clandestine recovery team to retrieve the object.&nbsp;&nbsp;<a href="#9">

<b><font color="#FFFF00">"The WRONG Liberty"</font></b></li>
</ul>
<font color="#FFFF00"><font size=-1>In researching the validity of the
account,<i> this author</i> placed a phone call to directory assistance
to acquire the telephone number of the Liberty Police Department. Unbeknownst
to both parties, the directory assistance operator had bungled the task
and furnished this author with the WRONG telephone number, instead, providing
him with the number of the Liberty Township Police Department, located
north of Youngstown, Ohio. A long distance phone contact was then placed
to the wrong Liberty, Ohio.&nbsp;</font><font size=-2><a href="#10"> 10</a></font></font>

<p><font color="#FFFF00"><font size=-1>"Hello, Liberty Township Police
Department," came the kindly greeting after the phone call was placed.</font></font>
<p><font color="#FFFF00"><font size=-1>"I?m trying to get some information
about the UFO report from a few years back that was reported to Wright-Patterson
Air Force Base," advised this caller.</font></font>
<p><font color="#FFFF00"><font size=-1>"Yes sir, I believe that was two
years ago ... "</font></font>
<ul>
<li>
<b><font color="#FFFF00"><font size=-1>Inflammatory Information</font></font></b><img SRC="Trumbul3.jpg" height=157 width=263 align=RIGHT></li>
</ul>
<font color="#FFFF00"><font size=-1>To the shock of the startled caller,
certain details gradually emerged which took nearly two weeks before it
was fully understood that a telephone mix-up had taken place, and that
the accounts in question involved two completely separate occurrences.
A two-year investigation followed, which revealed the details of an incredible
event in Trumbull County, Ohio, happening in December of 1994.&nbsp;</font><font size=-2>
<a href="#11">11</a></font></font>
<p><font color="#FFFF00"><font size=-1>Many police departments including
the Liberty Township Department, Howland, Hubbard and Girard City Police
Departments, as well as the Trumbull County Sheriffs Department, engaged
in an intense, late-night vehicular pursuit of a "red, saucer shaped object"
for several hours on December 14th. The object was described by police
officials as an enormous, brightly luminescent object that rotated, as
if on an axis. The object allegedly made no sound, and hovered directly
above housetops in a residential neighborhood at a disturbingly low elevation.</font></font>

<p><font color="#FFFF00"><font size=-1>Upon receiving phone calls to the
Trumbull County Dispatch Office by area residents, one of whom described
the UFO as a flaming object resembling the 'back end of a jet fighter,
Liberty Township police officer Tobe Melero was alerted to the situation.</font></font>
<p><font color="#FFFF00"><font size=-1>"I was drinking some coffee when
we started getting calls about a UFO, and we laughed about it," recalled
Melero. "But then we started getting more phone calls, so I had to go check
it out."&nbsp; </font><font size=-2><a href="#12">12</a></font></font>
<ul>
<li>
<b><font color="#FFFF00"><font size=-1>Roadside Stranger</font></font></b></li>
</ul>
<font color="#FFFF00"><font size=-1>While en route to the disturbance,
the officer told of how that he strangely encountered an elderly gentleman
<i>wandering
dazed and confused</i> on the dark and empty roadway. "I wish now that
I would have got his ID, or found out who he was," Melero said. "The poor
man was evidently lost, and he kept saying, <i><u>"It was right above my
house."</u></i></font></font>

<p><font color="#FFFF00"><font size=-1>Shortly afterward, the Liberty Township
police officer approached the object in an area near Churchill/Hubbard
Road, at which time he contends that the electrical instrumentation in
his patrol cruiser experienced a complete power failure.</font></font>
<p><font color="#FFFF00"><font size=-1>"It made no sound whatever," Melero
said, "and I couldn?t look directly at it because it was so bright. I had
to look around it."</font></font>
<p><font color="#FFFF00"><font size=-1>The dispatcher for the Trumbull
County Sheriff?s department, Ms. Royanne Rudolph, confirmed numerous calls
had been received regarding the object, which seemed to maintain a definite
interest over two adjacent residential neighborhoods. Families and residents
had taken to the streets in droves to view the phenomenon, which another
police officer of the Hubbard City Police Department advised, was pursued
for a six-hour duration.</font></font>
<ul>
<li>
<b><font color="#FFFF00">Deep, Dark and Scary</font></b></li>
</ul>
<font color="#FFFF00"><font size=-1>The Trumbull County 911 Dispatch Center
contacted numerous other agencies, requesting assistance and aircraft identification.
To the disbelief and dismay of the Trumbull County police officials, no
aircraft dispatch or technical assistance or support was advanced from
any of the agencies contacted, which also included the local FAA at Youngstown
Airport, the Youngstown-Warren Regional Air Force Base (Youngstown, Ohio),
and a nearby NASA facility (Cleveland, Ohio).&nbsp;</font></font><img SRC="911pat2.JPG" height=185 width=193 align=RIGHT>
<p><font color="#FFFF00"><font size=-1>According to Melero, NASA had offered
the dispatch office the notion that the planet Mercury was visible for
the duration of the occurrence.</font></font>
<p><font color="#FFFF00"><font size=-1>A county-wide pursuit of the UFO
was enacted by numerous police officers, many of whom approached the hovering
object from differing vantage points. By radio correspondence, <u>they
were able to triangulate its position. </u>It first appeared in an area
above Samson Drive and then drifted near Henheid Road before finally ascending
to a high elevation, appearing as a star in the sky.</font></font>

<p><font color="#FFFF00"><font size=-1>At the same time numerous police
officials were converging on the UFO, which was described as a <i>'structured'
object with a parachute-like appendage situated on the top of it, </i>the
FAA tower operator, mere miles from the scene of the UFO incident, claimed
not to have seen the UFO, even with binoculars and at a 70-foot elevation.
While fielding two separate phone calls from the Liberty Township police
dispatcher, the FAA tower operator also claimed to have <i>no radar track
of the UFO.</i></font></font>
<ul>
<li>
<b><font color="#FFFF00"><font size=-1>Sighting at the airbase</font></font></b></li>
</ul>
<font color="#FFFF00"><font size=-1>The FAA tower is part of the same facility
where the Youngstown Airbase is headquartered. During the pursuit of the
UFO, a police officer traveled to the airbase and confronted a security
guard at the facility. According to information conveyed on audio tape
from the incident, the security guard at the airbase also could not identify
the UFO.</font></font>
<p><font color="#FFFF00"><font size=-1>Strangely, while numerous police
officers work to identify and pursue the glowing intruder, more UFO's are
suddenly observed in various areas of Trumbull County.</font></font>
<p><font color="#FFFF00"><font size=-1>"We have two now, I think you'll
know what I mean," stated one officer into his radio.</font></font>
<p><font color="#FFFF00"><font size=-1>As more objects are suddenly observed,
the police officer at the airbase reports: "We have a bright light over
the airbase."</font></font>

<ul>
<li>
<b><font color="#FFFF00">The AREA</font></b></li>
</ul>
<font color="#FFFF00"><font size=-1>The region in question is adjacent
to a Defense Logistics Agency and National Defense Stockpile at 1740 Niles-Warren
River Road, one of the biggest radar/air defense installations in the United
States. The Youngstown Municipal Radar Air Defense Agency is also within
the locality.</font></font>
<p><font color="#FFFF00"><font size=-1>"Most people don?t realize," advised
a Hubbard police officer with great conviction, <i>"that this air base
out here is one of the best kept secrets in the whole damnable country.</i></font></font>
<p><font color="#FFFF00"><font size=-1>"Don?t kid yourself. You wouldn?t
believe the hardware."</font></font>
<p><font color="#FFFF00"><font size=-1>Repeated efforts to acquire the
specific date of the incident were unsuccessful until two years after initial
acquisition of the information, as no written report of the incident had
been produced by the Trumbull County 9-1-1 Dispatch Office.</font></font>
<p><font color="#FFFF00"><font size=-1>"They are stonewalling you, because
they don?t want you requesting the audio copies of those dispatch tapes,"
stated one officer in 1996 who was advised that this writer sought the
audio recordings made from the 911 Dispatch Center.</font></font>
<p><font color="#FFFF00"><font size=-1>"On those tapes, it?ll tell you
who all was involved in this, which implicates just about everyone."</font></font>

<p><font color="#FFFF00"><font size=-1>The officer even attempted to locate
the date himself, and expressed that his cohorts at the Trumbull County
Dispatch Office did not respond favorably when he began making inquiries.</font></font>
<p><font color="#FFFF00"><font size=-1><i>"Let me get right to the point,
all indication leads me to believe that the 911 Center is stonewalling
you!" </i>the officer charged in a letter he personally sent to this writer.
"I made an attempt to get some more information and ran into a very polite:<i>
'I can't remember. I don't recall!'</i></font></font>
<p><font color="#FFFF00"><font size=-1><i>"I've been around long enough
to know when someone is pissing down my neck and telling me it's raining
out!" </i>stated the angry officer.</font></font>
<p><font color="#FFFF00"><font size=-1>Another police officer, interviewed
privately, stated <i><u>"I don?t want my involvement with this known."</u></i></font></font>
<p><img SRC="911a.gif" height=211 width=298 align=LEFT><font color="#FFFF00"><font size=-1>In
an official letter from Robert J. Caffro, operations manager of Trumbull
County 911, he declared that: "the events under investigation are in no
way being discarded or restricted by this 911 center. As discussed during
prior conversations, we would need a date and approximate time of the occurrence
so that an audio copy could be produced."&nbsp; </font><font size=-2><a href="#13">13</a></font></font>

<ul>
<li>
<font color="#FFFF00"><font size=+1>Breakthrough</font></font></li>
</ul>
<font color="#FFFF00"><font size=-1>It was once thought that the time-frame
of the Trumbull County incident was somewhere in late August or early September,
as per comments from an officer who was interviewed. The officer, who was
not a witness to the event happening on December 14, equated the UFO sighting
with the fatal crash of a jetliner near Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania, where
a UFO sighting was reported in the vicinity of the calamity one day before
the disaster.</font></font>
<p><font color="#FFFF00"><font size=-1>A major break in the investigation
of this case came in May of 1998 when this writer was contacted by a telecommunicator
of the Trumbull County 9-1-1 dispatch center, who reviewed a report on
the Trumbull County incident which was available on the internet. <u>Acting
strictly as a private citizen,</u> the telecommunicator conducted his own
unofficial investigation, being compelled by the information which was
presented in the report. He acquired a date of the event: <b>December 14,
1994.</b></font></font>
<p><font color="#FFFF00"><font size=-1>In duplicating the information onto
audio tape, the telecommunicator commented: <i>"This event is totally unreal!"</i></font></font>
<ul>

<li>
<b><font color="#FFFF00">Intrigue at the AIR TOWER</font></b></li>
</ul>
<font color="#FFFF00"><font size=-1>At one point on the tape, a UFO is
reported by a Howland Township police officer who is observing the object
with a security guard at the airbase. A second UFO appears over the airbase,
and later, one police officer even speculates that military jets in the
air were scrambled from the base.</font></font>
<p><font color="#FFFF00"><font size=-1>Inquiries placed by this writer
with control tower radar operators at the Youngstown FAA revealed that
there are no current employees now on duty that would have been employed
at the air tower during this time frame.</font></font>
<p><font color="#FFFF00"><font size=-1>"All of those people were all fired.
There is only a core of two persons in upper level management here that
are hold-overs from then," advised the control tower telephone tattler.&nbsp;</font><font size=-2>&nbsp;<a href="#14">
14</a></font></font>
<p><font color="#FFFF00"><font size=-1>"All present employees were hired
at roughly the same time after the date in question."</font></font>
<p><font color="#FFFF00"><font size=-1>"Isn?t that a little unusual?" asked
the caller.</font></font>
<p><font color="#FFFF00"><font size=-1>"No, I don?t think so," came the
response. The spokesperson declared that nobody presently on-duty at the
FAA control tower has any knowledge of the event.</font></font>

<p><font color="#FFFF00"><font size=-1>After retrieval of the dispatch
tapes from the Trumbull County incident in May of 1998, a new inquiry was
placed with the Youngstown-Warren Regional Airport FAA Air Traffic Control
Tower regarding the UFO incident on December 14, 1994. The inquiry was
placed in writing through the Freedom of Information Act to the control
tower in Youngstown, Ohio, which was subsequently deferred to the Great
Lakes Regional Air Traffic Division..</font></font>
<ul>
<li>
<b><font color="#FFFF00"><font size=-1>Routine Response</font></font></b></li>
</ul>
<font color="#FFFF00"><font size=-1>In May of 1996, a telephone call placed
by this writer to the Youngstown Air Force Base regarding the UFO pursuit
was directed to the public information officer, who laughed bitterly upon
being advised the nature of the call.</font></font>
<p><font color="#FFFF00"><font size=-1>"I can assure you," he bellowed
with a distrustful spirit while going on to say that he would have been
"awoken" if anything like this had been true.</font></font>
<p><font color="#FFFF00"><font size=-1>"Nothing like that has EVER happened
here. I don?t know who your sources for this information is... and I?m
not looking to know... but REST ASSURED, your info is<u> COMPLETELY BOGUS.</u>
<b>You have been blasted with WRONG INFORMATION."</b></font></font>

<p><font color="#FFFF00"><font size=-1>This writer had the extreme desire
to correct the base officer by invoking the details of the multiple witness
event and the phone calls placed to his air base requesting assistance,
but elected to allow the gentleman to continue on his incorrect path of
sincere ignorance or deliberate concealment.</font></font>
<ul>
<li>
<b><font color="#FFFF00"><font size=-1>TRUE CENSORSHIP</font></font></b></li>
</ul>
<font color="#FFFF00"><font size=-1>The account of the UFO disturbance
over Trumbull County has been strangely blacked-out after the drama, as
none of the departments involved notified the news media of the event.</font></font>
<p><font color="#FFFF00"><font size=-1>There has been no press reportage
of the occurrence. After review of the 9-1-1 tapes, it is now known that
a news reporter with Channel 33 in Youngstown, Ohio, was completely aware
of this incident, and even received a phone call from a distressed resident
near Samson Road. The citizenry was never apprised.</font></font>
<p><font color="#FFFF00"><font size=-1>After a recent traffic accident
generated local headlines, one police official being interviewed by an
area reporter complained that the news media should have been just as interested
in the big UFO event as much as they were about the traffic accident. "The
reporter just laughed," observed the officer.</font></font>
<p><font color="#FFFF00"><font size=-1>The Trumbull County disturbance
remains a <u>volatile mystery.</u> Flaming the drama is the reshuffling
of the staff at the FAA tower and the heated denials by the Youngstown
Air base public relations officer, who stated that "the event never happened
to begin with." Also of great interest is the comment made by the FAA tower
operator who said that 'nothing could be visually observed' while a security
guard outside the very facility in question, accompanied by a Howland Township
police officer, watched the UFO. At one point, a second object appeared
'over the airbase.' <i>The disruption of the electronic instrumentation
of the Liberty Township patrol cruiser offers viable evidence that should
demand this case attain more widespread attention and scrutiny,</i> at
which time, the skeptical communities and debunking celebrities would have
a quality UFO case to thoroughly investigate; a case complete with numerous
witnesses, including police officials, reporting a massive, rotating saucer-shaped
red light which resulted in later Air Force denials and the appearance
of a conspiracy.&nbsp;</font></font>

<p><font color="#FFFF00"><font size=+1>NOTES:</font></font>
<p><a NAME="1"></a><font color="#F4F4F4"><font size=-1>1. Air Force Colonel
Mack McLaurin stated in USA TODAY, July 8, 1996: <i>"Our policy is that
if someone sights an unknown aircraft, their first action should be to
call the police."</i> Such responses rendered from an agency whose responsibility
it is to protect and defend the airspace of the country seems somewhat
inept, yet is an official policy directive simply due to the fact that
the agency no longer officially investigates the UFO situation after the

<p><i><font color="#FF0000"><font size=-1>This article, originally prepared
in June of 1996, was updated and revised in JUNE of 1998 to reflect the
acquisition of AUDIO DISPATCH TAPES of 9-1-1 correspondence from the Trumbull
County Sheriff's Department, after a date of the event was acquired by
two telecommunicators from the center who conducted their own private inquiry,
acting as citizens. Their investigations were unofficial, and not on behalf
of the department in any capacity, and were inspired by the original report
which was posted on the internet. The revised version reflects the discovery
of the DATE of this event, and omits previous speculation that the incident
was within the time-frame of the Pittsburgh jetliner calamity in September
of 1994. The Trumbull County event, happening in December, is not known
to have any correlation with the Pennsylvania jetliner tragedy.</font></font></i>
