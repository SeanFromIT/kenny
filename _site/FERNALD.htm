<P><B><I><FONT COLOR="#400040"><FONT SIZE=+1>Initial lead</FONT></FONT></I></B></P>

<P><B><FONT COLOR="#400040">While working a UFO exhibit at the Cincinnati
Convention Center during March of �97, I was approached by a certain individual
(more specific information on this person will not be disclosed out of
respect to the wishes for anonymity which has been made clear). He advised
me of a UFO sighting at the Fernald Uranium Processing plant near Ross,
Ohio. This informant, who we shall call Matt (Mysterious, Anonymous Tattle-Tale),
claimed to have been an employee at Fernald in the months before and after
the sighting. </FONT></B><TT><FONT COLOR="#008000">1</FONT></TT></P>

<P><B><FONT COLOR="#400040">Matt had been glancing at the table where still
photographs taken from the CLERMONT COUNTY RECORDING were displayed. He
pointed at one photograph of the triangular headlight arrangement and said,
&quot;It looked like this object.&quot; </FONT></B><TT><FONT COLOR="#008000">2</FONT></TT></P>

<P><B><FONT COLOR="#400040">I told him I was interested in the account
and asked how I could get in contact for a follow-up, but &quot;Matt&quot;
hesitated, and claimed to be afraid to give me a name.</FONT></B></P>

<P><B><FONT COLOR="#400040">He advised that the UFO had been videotaped
by a guard at the guardshack on NOVEMBER 24, 1994 <I>(two weeks after the
CLERMONT COUNTY RECORDING</I>). He said that the situation was perceived
as a security matter, and that the FAA was contacted and advised of the
event.</FONT></B></P>

<P><B><FONT COLOR="#400040">&quot;Matt&quot; also said that several people
at Fernald knew about it, that it had been �hushed up' and people were
instructed not to talk about it. </FONT></B></P>

<P><B><FONT COLOR="#400040">He said I should make an FOIA (Freedom of Information
Act) appeal with DOE (Department of Energy) to acquire the report on the
incident.</FONT></B></P>

<P><B><FONT COLOR="#400040">Also, &quot;Matt&quot; said that the videotape
had been examined by the video personnel at Fernald. Still images on the
recording had been �freeze framed' then xeroxed and distributed to a few
people who had access to the records. �Matt� implied that he was one of
those individuals.</FONT></B></P>

<P><B><FONT COLOR="#400040">I provided �Matt� with a business card that
included my address and phone number, and entertained high hopes that future
contact might be made. For weeks I thought of the conversation, but felt
my hopes languish as no further word of this strange tale came my way.
Then suddenly, on Wednesday, May 14, I received an envelope displaying
no name or return address. Inside was a word-processed letter which cryptically
stated the following:</FONT></B></P>

<UL>
<P><B><TT><FONT COLOR="#FF0000">location: the U.S. DOE Fernald Environmental
Management Project (now called Fluor-Daniel Fernald) <BR>
contents: stills of a security video camera</FONT></TT></B></P>
</UL>

<P><B><FONT COLOR="#400040">Enclosed as an attachment was a large 11 x
17&quot; sheet of paper bearing seven poor quality black &amp; white images
taken from a video camcorder. The date and time of the recording is tagged
onto the video, and the information indicates the date as November 23,
1994 (the informant had earlier stated November 24) and the time listed
is 5:48 a.m. The seconds are also displayed on the recording, and 5 of
the images appear in reverse sequence, from top to bottom, based upon the
arrangement of the digital clock so that the top image lists &quot;AM -
5:48:10&quot; while the bottom image lists &quot;AM - 5:48:08&quot;</FONT></B></P>

<CENTER><P><TT><FONT COLOR="#0000FF">Above: Still image captured from the
videotape which was<BR>
later acquired, computer analysis by Dale Farmer</FONT></TT></P></CENTER>

<UL>
<P><B><FONT COLOR="#400040">Of the seven pictures, four contain complete
images, the other three either leave the page or are broken due to copier
error. Two of the four clear images depict an object that resembles a lighted
[luminous?] donut. This element could be an abberation created by the internal
apparatus within the lense of the camera, and not a solid object.</FONT></B></P>

<P><B><FONT COLOR="#400040">However, the relative sharpness of the &quot;donut&quot;
images was also considered to be an artifact of the copier. Depending on
the contrast setting of the copier used, diffuse edges are ignored and
are filled in with either more &quot;white&quot; or more &quot;black.&quot;</FONT></B></P>

<P><B><FONT COLOR="#400040">This would not be, of course, an adequate analysis
until review of the videotape could be conducted.</FONT></B></P>

<P><B><I><FONT COLOR="#400040"><FONT SIZE=+1>INVESTIGATION</FONT></FONT></I></B></P>

<P><B><FONT COLOR="#400040">On Saturday, May 31, I set off with an associate
from a Cracker Barrel restaurant on Winton Road to proceed to the Fernald
plant, intending to speak to a guard at the guardshack. The journey to
Fernald was simply a fancy made on impulse with no prior planning. </FONT></B><TT><FONT COLOR="#008000">3</FONT></TT></P>

<P><B><FONT COLOR="#400040">Upon entering Ross, Ohio, we expected to find
the Fernald plant easily, but took a wrong turn somewhere and got lost.
Driving around for about 15 minutes, we found ourselves in Okeana and stopped
at the Okeana Grocery Store to ask for directions. Inside the store, three
passersby responded eagerly when asked for directions to Fernald. The clerk
commented, &quot;Just follow the glow.&quot; </FONT></B></P>

<P><B><FONT COLOR="#400040">This was greeted by some laughter and more
jokes until I had humorously added, &quot;Well, actually, we're looking
for UFOs anyway.&quot;</FONT></B></P>

<P><B><FONT COLOR="#400040">&quot;You may want to talk to some people at
the Fire Department, I've heard they saw them,&quot; came the sober response.
Although the clerk offered no specific details , he knew of information
that could be acquired through the fire department.</FONT></B></P>

<CENTER><P><IMG SRC="fersite.gif" HEIGHT=272 WIDTH=252><BR>
</P></CENTER>

<P><B><FONT COLOR="#400040">Directions were given and we found ourselves
approaching the guard shack at the ominous Fernald Uranium Processing site.
The guard remained seated in the small shack which was situated at the
main entrance to the plant as we drove the car up to the door. When advised
that we were investigating a reported UFO sighting in the area, the guard
stated, &quot;I know of a security guard who you may want to talk to. He's
not here tonight, but he saw one. It flew over one night on third shift.&quot;</FONT></B></P>

<P><B><FONT COLOR="#400040">The guard confirmed again that he had heard
stories, and said, &quot;I've heard about it, but I didn't see it. There
was something that was supposed to have come over.&quot;</FONT></B></P>

<P><B><FONT COLOR="#400040">When asked if there were any video recordings,
the guard answered, &quot;I'm not sure if there were or not.&quot;</FONT></B></P>

<CENTER><P><IMG SRC="Fplant.jpg" HEIGHT=198 WIDTH=300><BR>
<TT><FONT COLOR="#0000FF">Plant 4 underwent safe shutdown, decontamination
and dismantlement before being successfully imploded on Saturday, August
24, 1996. </FONT></TT></P></CENTER>

<P><B><FONT COLOR="#400040">The guard suggested we contact Lieutenant Paul
Disney, the supervisor in charge of security at FERMCO, the agency contracted
by Fernald to furnish plant security.</FONT></B></P>

<P><B><FONT COLOR="#400040">Suddenly aware that I was writing down this
information, the guard became uneasy and more reluctant to talk: &quot;Why
don't you come back later and talk to them about it?&quot;</FONT></B></P>

<P><B><FONT COLOR="#400040">This second-hand information provided �soft'
confirmation of a story first conveyed by &quot;Matt,&quot; an anonymous
whistle-blower who strangely told of his �fear� about involvement with
a story that had been �hushed up.�</FONT></B></P>

<P><B><I><FONT COLOR="#400040"><FONT SIZE=+1>HARD CONFIRMATION</FONT></FONT></I></B></P>

<P><B><FONT COLOR="#400040">I had contacted Mr. DALLAS at Fernald Security
and announced the nature of my call. According to Mr. Dallas, Lt. Disney
was unavailable until Wednesday, June 4. Dallas knew of the UFO sighting
but was unsure of a report filed on the incident. Dallas said, &quot;The
guys on third shift made a claim and a videotape of a UFO sighting.&quot;
</FONT></B><TT><FONT COLOR="#008000">4</FONT></TT></P>

<P><B><FONT COLOR="#400040">When asked whether or not the information would
be retained with Fernald or Firmco, Mr. Dallas said, &quot;It's all the
same,&quot; adding that the records would be accessible to the public.
&quot;If they kept anything, whether it be videotape or written reports,
you would be able to get that.&quot;</FONT></B></P>

<P><B><FONT COLOR="#400040">Dallas again suggested I contact Paul Disney,
who could address my inquiries better.</FONT></B></P>

<P><B><FONT COLOR="#400040">Thinking to take the �back door approach,�
I placed a few phone calls to the main security gate several times and
talked with the night-shift employees. One guard who answered the phone
began laughing hysterically when I placed my inquiry. <I>�Is this a joke?�</I>
he giggled as I sought to restore seriousness to the conversation. <I>�Who
is this?�</I> he chuckled, and from that point on, the inquiry went downhill.
The serious tone as I sought after was �down the commode� as I could sense
tears welling up in his eyes from hysterical laughter. Ultimately, his
silly conduct prevailed and I found myself somewhat humored by his giggly
demeanor as well. A phone call the next evening was not as mirthful, however,
as the receptionist taking my call �hung up� when I had asked for a certain
guard by name. Perhaps it was understood that I would be calling...</FONT></B></P>

<P><B><I><FONT COLOR="#400040"><FONT SIZE=+1>DISNEY SPEAKS</FONT></FONT></I></B></P>

<P><B><FONT COLOR="#400040">Days later I finally contacted Lieutenant Disney,
who also confirmed hearing of the UFO sighting and to have seen photos.
Disney said that he had heard stories of a &quot;ball or something in the
sky&quot; that was photographed, but didn't know what had become of the
material. He said he had seen the photos &quot;floating around&quot; from
time to time. </FONT></B><TT><FONT COLOR="#008000">5</FONT></TT></P>

<P><B><FONT COLOR="#400040">Disney deferred the call to Susan Walpole,
the Public Relations Manager for Fluor-Daniel Fernald. Disney stated, &quot;All
such off-site inquiries will be handled by the public relations department.
They want to be the ones to respond to any questions people have regarding
an incident or anything that may or may not have happened.&quot; </FONT></B></P>

<P><B><FONT COLOR="#400040">Disney wasn't sure how available this information
would be. The cameras used by the security staff are fixed cameras, but
are moveable and remotely controlled from a monitor room. The information
is recorded by means of a time-lapse recording system. When asked, he responded
that the guards &quot;do not use video camcorders and do not bring camcorders
to work with them.&quot; </FONT></B></P>

<CENTER><P><IMG SRC="Ferny.jpg" HEIGHT=143 WIDTH=431></P></CENTER>

<P><B><FONT COLOR="#400040">The Public Relations Supervisor, Susan Walpole,
was then contacted, and said she would research the story for me. Taking
my name and number, she assured a phone call would be returned. When asked
what procedures she would use to research the story, Walpole said she would
&quot;find out from the video people and other people, who, if anybody,
has the video and report,&quot; and added that it &quot;was not in public
affairs.&quot; She said she would make some phone calls to find out where
it &quot;exists on site.&quot; </FONT></B><TT><FONT COLOR="#008000">6</FONT></TT></P>

<P><B><FONT COLOR="#400040">The following afternoon, after awaiting a phone
call that never came, I again contacted the Public Relations Department,
where, not surprisingly, it was made clear that no videotape of a UFO over
Fernald was officially retained, and the spokesperson added: �I don�t have
any information for you.� </FONT></B><TT><FONT COLOR="#008000">7</FONT></TT></P>

<P><B><FONT COLOR="#400040">�The one guard who evidently saw it works on
third shift and I left a message but he hasn�t called back.� She released
the name of this individual (that will not appear in this text), who she
said was the �witness to the incident.�</FONT></B></P>

<P><B><FONT COLOR="#400040">The search inquiries were made with the communications
center where no record of the event or video was said to exist, the multi-media
visual (&quot;the AV people&quot;), where they reportedly searched their
database and no video was found. A check was also made with three or four
persons in security who equally did not claim to have the video.</FONT></B></P>

<P><B><FONT COLOR="#400040">A phone call was again placed to Lt. Disney,
where he was asked if I could acquire records and logs. He was also asked
if I could make arrangements to speak directly with the security guard.</FONT></B></P>

<P><B><FONT COLOR="#400040">Disney said, &quot;Sure, he works on third
shift though.&quot;</FONT></B></P>

<P><B><FONT COLOR="#400040">I went on to add that I had made several late-night
phone calls and couldn't reach him, and I would rather find out a good
night to call. Disney stepped away breifly to check his schedule, then
came back and said &quot;Uh-oh, it looks like this gentleman will be on
vacation for several weeks. He just took off.&quot;</FONT></B></P>

<P><B><I><FONT COLOR="#400040"><FONT SIZE=+1>Continued Haggling</FONT></FONT></I></B></P>

<P><B><FONT COLOR="#400040">Susan Walpole, Public Relations Supervisor
of Fluor-Danile Fernald, was again contacted after a delayed response to
my previous inquiries. She said that she had been making numerous inquiries
with different persons, and still turning up negative results. </FONT></B><TT><FONT COLOR="#008000">8</FONT></TT></P>

<P><B><FONT COLOR="#400040">She checked for any AEDO reports (Assistant
Emergency Duty Officer) which is a 24 hour office which fills out a log
of any �off-normal occurences.� These reports are routed to the duty officer
who keeps a log of incidents. She also consulted with the person in charge
of emergency operations center with no results (I inquired if this would
have been perceived as an emergency situation, and she said, �I don�t think
so�).</FONT></B></P>

<P><B><FONT COLOR="#400040">She also checked the Fire &amp; Safety log
plus the SHIFT LOG. She assured that she would furnish me with the names
of the people who were on duty during the event.</FONT></B></P>

<P><B><FONT COLOR="#400040">Regarding the videotape, she didn�t know if
the Fernald security systems embed a date and time stamp onto their video
recordings, but said she would find out for me. She said that the Fire
&amp; Safety people retain a personal camcorder at all times, and they
may be the ones who recorded the video.</FONT></B></P>

<P><B><FONT COLOR="#400040">Overall, it looked as if nothing substantive
would come of the Fernald story.</FONT></B></P>

<P><B><I><FONT COLOR="#400040"><FONT SIZE=+1>PREVIOUS UFO SIGHTINGS</FONT></FONT></I></B></P>

<P><B><FONT COLOR="#400040">A quick review of Fernald history revealed
that an Unidentified Flying Object was reported over the FERNALD URANIUM
PROCESSING PLANT on August 25, 1955. This event, witnessed by police Sgt.
Ralph Weber, Patrolman Ernest Nehree and Patrolman Maurice Wiseman, was
observed at 10:55 p.m. The �flickering red glow� over the atom plant was
described as 'something like the exhaust from an airliner, which flickered.'
The object reportedly would drop 100 to 300 feet and then go back up, sometimes
darting 'side to side' like it couldn't stay stationary. The Cincinnati
Post reported that the Atomic Energy Commission had launched an investigation
into the matter. </FONT></B><TT><FONT COLOR="#008000">9</FONT></TT></P>

<P><B><FONT COLOR="#400040">On April 10, 1983, an unknown object was visually
observed by two motorists and an area resident in the vicinities of Layhigh
Road and Hamilton-New London Road, both near Route 748. A power failure
and unusual animal response followed as the object then landed in a field.
A 50-foot circular area of effected ground was discovered, its outer fringes
were scorched and there were several broken branches found there, having
been forcefully removed from a nearby tree. A 3-foot �burned area� was
found at the center of the effected region. After meticulous research by
Ron Schaffner and other investigators, this case remains unexplained. This
location is 4.5 miles northeast of the Fernald facility. </FONT></B><TT><FONT COLOR="#008000">10</FONT></TT></P>

<P><B><I><FONT COLOR="#400040"><FONT SIZE=+1>Interview with the Security
Guard</FONT></FONT></I></B></P>

<P><B><FONT COLOR="#400040">After several weeks of patience, I thought
it time to contact the security guard, thinking he may have since returned
from his vacation.</FONT></B></P>

<P><B><FONT COLOR="#400040">A 1:00 a.m. telephone call was made to the
Fernald Security department, and a long talk with the primary witness finally
made. The witness, also a part-time police officer, was willing to provide
the tantalizing details of this mysterious event. </FONT></B><TT><FONT COLOR="#008000">11</FONT></TT></P>

<P><B><FONT COLOR="#400040">�I was just out on perimeter patrol enroute
to stationary post, and there was this light in the sky that followed me,�
stated the officer. �It looked like this thing had landing lights. When
I turned, it turned, and just set there. It hovered east of my location,
over the Hamilton parking lot.�</FONT></B></P>

<CENTER><P><IMG SRC="fern2.jpg" HEIGHT=203 WIDTH=273></P></CENTER>

<P><B><FONT COLOR="#400040">�It first appeared to be about the same elevation
as routine air traffic, it was going due south, and then when I turned
west, this thing turned around and followed me, so then I thought this
was a helicopter. I rolled the window down and didn�t hear any sound, so
then I called the Control Center.�</FONT></B></P>

<P><B><FONT COLOR="#400040">�Someone from the Control Center evidently
swung their cameras around and was able to pick this up from a remote location.
When 'The County' showed up, there were still photos of this thing that
was given to them.�</FONT></B></P>

<CENTER><P><IMG SRC="Fern3.jpg" HEIGHT=202 WIDTH=271></P></CENTER>

<P><B><FONT COLOR="#400040">�The Hamilton County Sheriff�s Department was
summoned to the scene by someone from the Control Center, and they talked
to me in the Administration Building and also took a report.�</FONT></B></P>

<P><B><FONT COLOR="#400040">The unidentified aircraft, described by the
guard as a silent light which moved from north to south before suddenly
hovering like a helicopter, performed a banking maneuver that could not
be duplicated by conventional aircraft. According to the security guard,
the object departed Fernald by lifting to a high elevation and hovering
stationary in the sky, appearing as a star until well after daylight.</FONT></B></P>

<P><B><I><FONT COLOR="#400040"><FONT SIZE=+1>Inquiries with Hamilton County
9-1-1</FONT></FONT></I></B></P>

<P><B><FONT COLOR="#400040">Dave Matthews, supervisor of the Hamilton County
Communications Center, confirmed that the call was received and also furnished
an �incident advisory� which states the time and nature of the call, plus
the name of the two officers that handled the report. A notation on the
log states: �strange sphere with strange lights sighted over Fernald.�
</FONT></B><TT><FONT COLOR="#008000">12</FONT></TT></P>

<P><B><FONT COLOR="#400040">�This was just a routine call,� stated Matthews,
�we get UFO calls all the time. I am just one of nine supervisors here,
and on my watch, I�ve handled about 250 to 300 calls for UFO reports in
Hamilton County since 1974,� informed the 9-1-1 supervisor.</FONT></B></P>

<P><B><FONT COLOR="#400040">�UFO reports are considered a Priority 3, or
routine, simply because such reports are not deemed emergency situations.
If we had sufficient information that would warrant an emergency-type response,
then we would upgrade the priority status of these type of reports, but
at this time, we do not have such information,� Matthews said.</FONT></B></P>

<CENTER><P><IMG SRC="Fern4.jpg" HEIGHT=197 WIDTH=265></P></CENTER>

behind trees, which can be seen in the foreground</FONT></TT></P></CENTER>

<P><B><I><FONT COLOR="#400040"><FONT SIZE=+1>The Videotape is Acquired</FONT></FONT></I></B></P>

<P><B><FONT COLOR="#400040">Initially, persons at F.E.M.P. denied that
a videotape of a UFO sighting over Fernald was actually retained or even
made at the facility. But suddenly, at a staff meeting on Monday, July
1, the videotape finally surfaced.</FONT></B></P>

<P><B><FONT COLOR="#400040">Arrangements were hastily made and the tape
was hand-delivered by Fernald officials at the �badge-issuing trailer�
on-site. </FONT></B></P>

<P><B><FONT COLOR="#400040">�The reason we couldn�t find it the first time
was because it was held by a D.O.E. official,� stated the cordial employee.</FONT></B></P>

<CENTER><P><IMG SRC="Fern1.jpg" HEIGHT=189 WIDTH=254></P></CENTER>

<CENTER><P><TT><FONT COLOR="#0000FF">This was the graphic created by the
F.E.M.P.<BR>
video department, which tags and identifies<BR>
the beginning of the videotape.</FONT></TT></P></CENTER>

<P><B><FONT COLOR="#400040">The videotape depicts a glaring light which
shines toward the camera like a spotlight, only much brighter. Another
videotape of the event was also recorded from a communications center camera,
and it depicts an odd-looking light hovering in the sky, and then jump-cuts
to the phenomenon as it hovers behind trees. Many voices can be heard saying,
�Look at it, look at it!� and �didn�t it just move?� </FONT></B></P>

<P><B><FONT COLOR="#400040">One person declares, <I>�I�ve been working
third-shift too long!�</I></FONT></B></P>

<P><B><FONT COLOR="#400040">The images from the two cameras have been edited
by the F.E.M.P. video department, and dubbed onto one videocassette labeled
�Unidentified Object at the F.E.M.P.� The edited sequences are out of order,
as per the time listed on the date-stamp within the video frame. There
is some indication that there were other sequences not included on the
video which had been edited out, based upon the gaps in the video date/time-stamp.</FONT></B></P>

<P><B><I><FONT COLOR="#400040"><FONT SIZE=+1>Brief Reflections</FONT></FONT></I></B></P>

<P><B><FONT COLOR="#400040">The 1994 Fernald UFO event happened during
a spate of UFO sightings around the Cincinnati area. Two weeks prior, a
Clermont County resident recorded a home-video of a <A HREF="https://home.fuse.net/task/Owensville.htm">triangular
headlight configuration</A> which performed an odd maneuver during a rain
shower. Before that, a UFO was reported to the Forest Park Police Department
by motorists near the Forest Fair Mall.</FONT></B></P>

<P><B><FONT COLOR="#400040">Looking back over this affair, the most outstanding
aspect isn�t an overflight of an unidentified flying object above this
facility, it is the �hush hush� mannerism in which the incident was handled
afterwards. The silence a byproduct not of a great secrecy machine, but
moreso an offshoot of a convenient �file it away� approach assumed by Fernald
and Hamilton County 9-1-1. The video, deemed valuable to UFO researchers
and investigators, would furnish excellent material for analysis and computer
scrutiny. The participants did not recognize neither the common proliferation
of UFO material in our society in which certain interest may be gathered
from this happening, nor did they acknowledge the apparent value of the
recording in the hands of credible investigators. It found its place on
a shelf somewhere, known only among those privileged few.</FONT></B></P>

<P><B><FONT COLOR="#400040">This sort of event, if happening in the late
80�s, would have been an considered intrusive to the security of The United
States due to the sensitivity of the Fernald operation.</FONT></B></P>

<P><B><FONT COLOR="#400040">But more interesting was the look in the eyes
of Matt, the mysterious informant who seemed to express fear upon the telling
of this account, as he cryptically stated, �Let me just tell you, this
is something I don�t want to get involved with.�</FONT></B>

on November 10, 1994 near U.S. Route 50 in Owensville, Ohio, and reported
in The Cincinnati Post, The Middletown Journal and also on WXIX TV-19 News.
The videotape depicts images of a triangular-shaped headlight configuration
which may be explainable as common air traffic. However, there remain numerous
questions about the maneuvers in progress as well as the computer analysis
of the video, which left more questions than answers.</FONT></TT></P>

<P><TT><FONT COLOR="#008000">3. The Fernald Environmental Management Project
(FEMP) is located about 18 miles northwest of Cincinnati, Ohio. Between
1953 and 1989, the U.S. Department of Energy (DOE) facility, then called
the &quot;Feed Materials Production Center,&quot; produced uranium metal
products for the nation�s defense programs. The FEMP�s products were used
in production reactors to make plutonium and tritium at other DOE sites.
In 1992, Fluor Daniel Fernald assumed responsibility for managing all cleanup
activities at the FEMP under a contract with DOE. Formerly known as the
Fernald Environmental Restoration Management Corp., Fluor Daniel Fernald
