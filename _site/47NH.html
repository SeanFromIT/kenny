<br><b><font size=+2>for finding �Flying Saucer�</font></b>

July 11, 1947 � page 1</font></li>
</ul>
The first fragment of a flying disc reported found was brought into the
Argus office Wednesday afternoon by Fred Hunt, a forester at Corbin Park.
<p>Hunt alleged that the fragment had been found after the Rindge, N.H.
Fire Department had extinguished a fire in a vancant lot in that town Monday
afternoon. He said, �It burned knee-high grass like gas.� He turned the
first two pieces he found over to the firemen but kept a third he had found
across the street from the scene. The fragments which scattered over a
200 foot area on both sides of the road in W. Rindge and burned wherever
they landed, were sent to Harvard University for investigation, Hunt alleged.
<p>Hunt, a graduate of the University of New Hampshire School of Forestry
in June, firmly believed that it was a piece of the saucer and was in quest
of the $1,000 reward he had heard was being offered. Hunt said, �I figured
the curve of the cast iron fragment and I think that the whole disc had
a diameter of 8 inches.�
<p>Chief of Police John Crosby, Jr., of Rindge declined to comment on the
question when called by this newspaper, however, an official of the town
who requested his name be withheld, was of the opinion that the object
which he claimed landed in several pieces rather than breaking up on landing,
was a meteorite. He said that a dozen or more pieces were found and that
he tried to piece several together, but was unable to match the grooves.
Anything he said, continued the official, was pure guess work on the part
of an amateur. In the opinion of those who have seen the specimen at the
Argus-Champion, it is definitely a man made object, such as a shell fragment
or airplane flare.
<p>Hunt�s souvenier rests in the safe of the Argus-Champion. Anyone qualified
is invited to examine it.
