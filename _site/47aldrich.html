<br><font face="Impact"><font size=+3>Report on "Crashed Discs"</font></font>
<br><font face="Lucida Handwriting"><font size=+1>by Jan Aldrich</font></font></center>

<p><font face="Lucida Console">By the 8th of July foolishness was starting
to get the upper hand, reports had fallen off, and the P-38 Montana story
had proved false. The popular columnist, Hal Boyle, ran a two-part story
about being kidnapped from</font>
<br><font face="Lucida Console">an Oklahoma bar by a big hairy Martian.
These columns ran in well over 1000</font>
<br><font face="Lucida Console">newspapers. Many witnesses especially women
felt, partly because of Boyle's column, they had to end their UFO reports
with a statement about their alcohol consumption habits.</font>
<p><font face="Lucida Console">Dewitt Miller, a Fortean Society member,
wrote a widely read article on Charles Fort, strange sky objects seen in
the past and the possibility that UFO origins are extraterrestrial. Other
Fortean Society members are quoted in local or national news stories during
the 1947 UFO wave.</font>
<p><font face="Lucida Console">Towards the end of the day in some western
newspaper the first news</font>
<br><font face="Lucida Console">stories on Roswell started to appear. Generally
they are not detailed and</font>
<br><font face="Lucida Console">again the press is led on by a fantastic
episode.</font>
<p><font face="Lucida Console">July 9th was about the center point of the
worldwide coverage of the catholic priest with a circular saw blade which
landed near him. Many newspaper headed this as a flying disc story or something
like "See Saw, He</font>
<br><font face="Lucida Console">Saw." Hal Boyle's second installment appears
in many papers. He is able to</font>
<br><font face="Lucida Console">escape back to earth, but is worry about
his expense account.</font>
<p><font face="Lucida Console">The story of Roswell about "captured" disc
appeared in most newspapers many times married up with the Brigadier General
Ramey press conference. The contention was the debris recovered was a weather
instrument.</font>
<p><font face="Lucida Console">Stories about people who found various balloon
borne apparatus or items</font>
<br><font face="Lucida Console">that fell off aircraft were featured in
a large number of newspapers during and immediately after the wave.&nbsp;
Besides natural material and man-made material which came to earth in the
natural course of events, many prankster planted crudely made flying discs.&nbsp;
Possibly some of these devices were built with the idea that the people
who offered the rewards for a UFO could be fooled into awarding the prizes.&nbsp;
Since most "crashed discs" are very primitive, the fabricators probably
decided instead to plant them somewhere and watch the proceedings.&nbsp;
A small sample of such "crashed discs" stories are shown below.</font>

<blockquote>
<blockquote><font face="Lucida Console"><font size=-1>&nbsp;&nbsp; "I noticed
in this morning's paper an article on the last page, I believe datelined
from Chillilcothe, anent [sic] a peculiar star-shaped object found in a
corn field by a farmer.</font></font><font face="Lucida Console"><font size=-1></font></font>
<p><font face="Lucida Console"><font size=-1>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "I recognized
the object immediately and am writing to clear up the mystery.&nbsp; It
just so happens that I am quite familiar with said objects having sent
up several hundred of them while in the army weather service. They happen
to be radar targets.&nbsp; They are fastened about six feet below a large
hydrogen inflated balloon, which I would judge is four or five feet in
diameter when fully inflated, and contrary to the usual description of
the flying saucer, they ascend almost vertically, depending upon the wind
velocity and also go up very slowly.&nbsp; They are made of laminated foil
and kraft paper material and are supported by thin wooden sticks.&nbsp;
The foil covering on the under side of the target allows the radar signal
to be reflected to the radar instrument.</font></font></blockquote>

<blockquote>
<blockquote><font face="Lucida Console"><font size=-1>&nbsp;&nbsp; "These
targets are very useful in plotting wind direction and velocity on cloudy
days when a weather balloon could not be followed with the ordinary weather
theodolite due to clouds.</font></font></blockquote>

<p><br><font face="Lucida Console">On the 9th of July at 1:00 p. m. reporters
observed a balloon</font>
<br><font face="Lucida Console">release with radar targets at Alamogrodo.
This story was carried in some</font>
<br><font face="Lucida Console">newspapers the next day. It was not widely
reported.&nbsp; Several balloon</font>
<br><font face="Lucida Console">releases by Army, Navy and weather bureau
personal were made for newsmen</font>
<br><font face="Lucida Console">during the next few days. A story is headline
on the "Army, Navy Work to</font>

<blockquote><font face="Lucida Console"><font size=-1>Reports of flying
saucers whizzing through the sky fell off sharply today as the army and
navy began a concentrated campaign to stop the rumors.<br>
<br>
One by one, persons who thought they had their hands on the $3,000 offered
for a genuine flying saucer found their hands full of nothing.</font></font></blockquote>
</blockquote>

<blockquote>
<blockquote><br>
<font face="Lucida Console"><font size=-1>Headquarters of the 8th army
at Fort Worth, Texas. announced that the wreckage of a tin-foil covered
object found on a New Mexico ranch was nothing more than the remnants of
a weather balloon. AAF headquarters in Washington reportedly delivered
a "blistering" rebuke to officers at the Roswell, New Mexico, base for
suggesting that it was a "flying disc."<br>
<br>
A 16 inch aluminum disc equipped with two radio condensers, a florescent
light switch and copper tubing found by F.G. Harston near the Shreveport,
Louisiana, business district was declared by police to be "obviously the
work of a prankster." Police believed the prankster hurled it over a sign
board and watched it land at Harston's feet. It was turned over to officials
at Barksdale army air field.</font></font></blockquote>
</blockquote>

<blockquote>
<blockquote><font face="Lucida Console"><font size=-1>U.S. naval intelligence
officers at Pearl Harbor investigated claims by 100 navy men that they
saw a mysterious object "silvery colored, like aluminum, with no wings
or tail," sail over Honolulu at a rapid clip late yesterday. The description
fit a weather balloon but 5 of the men, familiar with weather observation
devices, swore that it was not a balloon.</font></font></blockquote>
</blockquote>

<blockquote>
<blockquote><font face="Lucida Console"><font size=-1>"It moved extremely
fast for a short period, seemed to slow down, then disappeared high in
the air," said Yeoman 1/C Douglas Kacherle of New Bedford, Massachusetts.
His story was corroborated by Seaman 1/C Donald Ferguson, Indianapolis;
Yeoman 3/C Morris Kzamme, La. Crosse, Wisconsin, Seaman 1/C Albert Delancey,
Salem, West Virginia, and Yeoman 2/C Ted Pardue, McClain, Texas.</font></font></blockquote>
</blockquote>

<blockquote>
<blockquote><font face="Lucida Console"><font size=-1>Admiral William H.
Blandy, commander-in-chief of the Atlantic fleet, said like everyone else
he was curious about the reported flying saucers "but I do not believe
they exist."&nbsp;<br>
<br>
Lloyd Bennett, Oelwein, Iowa, salesman, was stubborn about the shiny 6
1/2-inch steel disc he found yesterday. Authorities said it was not a "flying
saucer" but Bennett said he would claim the reward offered for the mysterious
discs.</font></font></blockquote>
</blockquote>
<br>
<font face="Lucida Console">There were other discards. Not all the principles
were satisfied with the annoucement that the wreckage found on the New
Mexico ranch was that of a weather ballon.</font>
<p><font face="Lucida Console">The excitement ran through this cycle:</font>
<blockquote><font face="Lucida Console">1. Lt. Warren Haught, public relations
officer at the Roswell base, released a statement in the name of Col. William
Blanchard, base commander. It said that an object described as a "flying
disc" was found on the nearby Foster ranch 3 weeks ago by W.W.Brazel and
been sent to "higher officials" for examination.</font>
<br><br>
<font face="Lucida Console">2. Brigadier General Roger B. Ramey, commander
of the 8th airforce, said at Fort Worth that he believed the object was
the "remnant of a weather balloon and a radar reflector," and was "nothing
to be excited about" He allowed photographers to take a picture of it.
It was announced that the object would be sent to Wright Field, Dayton,
Ohio for examination by experts.<br>
<br>
3. Later, Warrant Officer Irving Newton, Stessonville, Wisconsin, weather
officer at Fort Worth, examined the object and said definitely that it
was nothing but a badly smashed target used to determine the direction
and velocity of high altitude winds.<br>
<br>
4. Lt. Haught reportedly told reporters that he has been "shut up by two
blistering phone calls from Washington."<br>
<br>
5. Efforts to contact Col. Blanchard brought the information that "he is
now on leave."<br>
<br>
6. Maj. Jesse A. Marcel, intelligence officer of the 509th bombardment
group, reportedly told Brazel, the finder of the object, that "it has nothing
to do with army or navy so far as I can tell."<br>
<br>
7. Brazel told reporters that he has found weather ballon equipment before,
but had seen nothing that had resembled his latest find.<br>
<br>
8. Those men who saw the object said it had a flowered paper tape around
it bearing the initials "D.P."</font></blockquote>

<p><br><font face="Lucida Console">On the 10th and 11th two more "crashed
disc" stories get worldwide coverage.&nbsp; A disk shaped obect is found
in Hollywood, California and another</font>
<br><font face="Lucida Console">in Twin Falls, Idaho. In both cases the
hoaxes are quickly identified. The</font>
<br><font face="Lucida Console">FBI is involved in both case. The Twin
Falls, Idaho hoax made of juke box</font>
<br><font face="Lucida Console">parts is turned over to the Army at Fort
Douglas, Utah. No mention of this</font>
<br><font face="Lucida Console">case is found in the Project Blue Book
files; just as no mention is found of</font>
<br><font face="Lucida Console">the Roswell case. The Hollywood and Twin
Falls reports were the coup de grace of press wire coverage. Now mostly
foreign or humor stories were the only ones reported. Seldom was a US sighting
report seen nationwide on the wireservices after this date. Region reports
were more common. Reports from South America and other parts of the world
do appear.</font>
<p><font face="Lucida Console">Ted Bloecher curtailed his search in newspapers
at this point. We have, therefore, and artifical drop off of reports at
this time due to search methodology. The delay in reporting a UFO sighting
can sometimes be three to seven days. There is a drop off due to wire service
withdrawal, but the drop off is more gradual than previously shown.</font>
<p><font face="Lucida Console">Besides the US officials, the military or
defense ministries in Canada, Mexico, Venezuela and Brazil all feel it
necessary to comment on the sky phenomena.&nbsp; The comments range from
"Bring one in" to "fantasy." In Brazil the US AAF weather balloon explanation
was cited by authorites.</font>
<p><font face="Lucida Console">On the afternoon of 10th of July a remarkable
sighting took place which</font>
<br><font face="Lucida Console">would influence the official investigation
of over the next two years and</font>
<br><font face="Lucida Console">would be reflected on their sighting report
questionaire.&nbsp; Near Stephenville</font>
<br><font face="Lucida Console">Cross, Newfoundland three men returning
by car from a fishing trip when they</font>
<br><font face="Lucida Console">saw a bluish-black vapor trail. It cut
a channel through the clouds estimated to be at 8,000 to 10,000 feet. It
parted the clouds. One of the observers got a camera and took to photographs
of the gap that had been</font>
<br><font face="Lucida Console">opened in the clouds. They viewed a seemingly
translucent disk-like wheel</font>
<br><font face="Lucida Console">travelling at a high rate of speed and
parting the clouds behind it. The</font>
<br><font face="Lucida Console">explanation generally put forth for this
report is a low altitude meteor. If that were so, one would think that
meteor tracer would want to see this</font>
<br><font face="Lucida Console">case and it would be examined in the scientific
literature.&nbsp; Not a chance.</font>
<br><font face="Lucida Console">It has the three letter intitials UFO that
consign it to scientific limbo.</font>
<br><font face="Lucida Console">The only enquiring mines that will look
a UFOs are the one's that get their</font>
<br><font face="Lucida Console">material of the supermarket checkout line
magazine racks.</font>
<p><font face="Lucida Console">The importance attached to this event can
be seen in the Project Sign, the first US Air Force UFO investigations
project, "Essental Elements of Information" (EEI) form.&nbsp; EEI are the
data that the intelligence personnel</font>

<p><font face="Lucida Console">During the 7-11 July columnists, including
the Alsop brothers, and editors expressed concerns that the flying discs
have unpreparedness in the field of Air Defense. While it seemed unlikely
that the Russian had jumped ahead, it was a possibility they felt which
should be considered. Some research in the connection of Air Defense with
the UFO question has been done. Much is left to be done. Of course such
official studies would be out of the public's ken and without a whisper
about flying saucers.</font>
<p><font face="Lucida Console">Exactly when the military began a serious
concerted effort to investigate UFOs is not clear. Reports were gather
early on, but the order to interview Kenneth Arnold and Richard Rankin
only went out to 4th Air Force on the 10th of July. In the Chronicle Section
are numerous examples of sighting by military personnel for which reports
were&nbsp; not in official files (NIOF) .&nbsp; The FBI did investigate
the reports almost from the first. The FBI dropped out when J. Edgar Hoover
found that the Air Force wanted to palm off the hoax "crashed discs" on
the Bureau and leave the actual investigations for the Air Force.</font>
