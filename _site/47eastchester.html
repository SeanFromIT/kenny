Eastchester � Eastchester came up with its own version of a flying (?)
disc on Saturday night, but whether the gadget flew into town under its
own power or was placed here by a practical prankster was still being investigated
today by Eastchester Police.
<p>On his evening constitutional on Saturday, Lawrence Castellucci of 69
Homestead Avenue, noticed a shiny metal object stuck in the hedge bordering
his front lawn. This �what�s it� has since been described by various persons
as (1) �a cookie can cover,� (2) a �pie plate� (3) a �cracker tin cover.�
<p><b><font size=+1>Equipped With Tube</font></b>
<p>Flying or otherwise, the disc carries on its surface a clutter of mechanical
contrivances including a radio tube, a transformer, a condenser and another
gadget, which police describe as a �radio speaker unit.� If that adds up
to a flying machine, Eastchester may have a flying disc.
<p>The disc is about ten inches in diameter and is surrounded by a rim
about one inch high. The condenser and the transformer have Japanese markings
and are unquestionably of Japanese origin. The radio tube is a �Majestic
G-38.�
<p>The joker on the contraption is a white label with red trimming on top
of the disc. It bears the admonition in English, �Finder, please return
to Tokyo Rose, Japan.
<p>After finding the disc, cracker tin cover, cookie can cover or whatever
it is, Mr. Castellucci took it around to his neighbors on the theory a
youngster might have lost a toy. Later, however, neighbors and Mrs. Castellucci
convinced him that the thing should be turned over to the Eastchester police
for investigation.
<p>Sergeant Joseph Gal dispatched Patrolman Fred Speidell in a radio car
to pick up the �thing� and bring it back to headquarters. After one quick
look, Sergeant Gal said �If that thing can fly, so can I.�
<p><b><font size=+1>Sergeant Gal is Skeptical</font></b>
<p>If the contraption is the work of a prankster, he took considerable
trouble to assemble the device. The gadgets are bolted and soldered to
the plate as if by a competent mechanic.
<p>Police theorized that some GI may have brought the condenser and transformer
back from Japan as souveniers, and assembled the disc to resemble a similar
contraption reported found in Maryland last week.
<p>The disc is held in �protective custody� in Eastchester Police Headquarters.
Just to make sure that it doesn�t take any wild notions to fly off somewhere,&nbsp;
police have disassembled most of the mechanical parts.
