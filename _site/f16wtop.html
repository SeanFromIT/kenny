Several people called WTOP Radioreporting seeing a bright blue or orange ball moving very fast, being chasedby jets.<p>Rogers says there was no smoke coming from the object, no flashing lights,and says it was smooth, and eerily silent.<p>The Air National Guard confirms they scrambled the 113th squadron.
