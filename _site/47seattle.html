July of 1947 was a banner month for the practical jokers.&nbsp; A Seattle,
Wash., woman excitedly reported to police that a flaming flying disc had
landed on her roof.&nbsp;&nbsp; The object, which was quickly extinguished,
was turned over to the Federal agents and examined by Navy bomb and electronics
experts.&nbsp;&nbsp; It consisted of a 28 inch circular piece of plywood
cupped up on two sides and held in position by a wire stretched across
the center.&nbsp;&nbsp; The letters "USSR" and "EYR" and a hammer and sickle
were painted on the disc in white.&nbsp;&nbsp; Two radio tubes and a quart
cylindrical shaped oil can were mounted on pieces of bakelite inside the
object and a cloth saturated&nbsp; with a turpentine-like substance and
charred from burning was attached to it. Final consensus was that the disc
could not fly and was undoubtedly the work of practical jokers.</font></font><font face="Arial Narrow"><font size=+1></font></font>

<p><font face="Arial Narrow"><font size=+1>A source in Seattle "reported
flying disk had landed on her roof about nine forty two PM last night,
that it was burning" but "immediately extinguished.&nbsp; She also advised
ONI [Office of Naval Intelligence], and disk fell short distance from their
offices."&nbsp; Agents were "immediately dispatched to scene," taking the
disk to ONI offices where it was examined by Navy and Air electronics experts.&nbsp;
The object measured about 28 inches.</font></font><font face="Arial Narrow"><font size=+1></font></font>
<p><font face="Arial Narrow"><font size=+1>"Mounted on pieces of bakelite
in the center of the inside of the disk were two radio tubes, which were
wired up and also so mounted was about a quart type of cylindrical shaped
oil can to which was fitted a short piece of rubber tubing running from
can to entrance to a piece of one inch [word obliterated by stamp mark]
about fourteen inches long.&nbsp; The pipe extended through the disk and
at the outer end of the pipe was about a six inch piece of cloth which
was wound about and stuck into the end of the pipe."</font></font><font face="Arial Narrow"><font size=+1></font></font>
<p><font face="Arial Narrow"><font size=+1>Observing the hammer and sickle
plus the odd words, analysts suggested that "EYR" was actually "RYE printed
backward".</font></font><font face="Arial Narrow"><font size=+1></font></font>
<p><font face="Arial Narrow"><font size=+1>"Consensus of all present" was
that "disk could not fly.&nbsp; Disk presently in possession of ONI Seattle
and so investigation being conducted.&nbsp; No publicity thus far and no
comment being made in event press inquiries are received."</font></font><font face="Arial Narrow"><font size=+1></font></font>
