<P><FONT COLOR="#FFFF00"><FONT SIZE=+2>Trumbull County Investigation: Northside
Hospital </FONT></FONT></P>

<P><FONT COLOR="#FFFF00"><FONT SIZE=-1>A call was placed to the Northside
Medical Center to determine if Air Care helicopter flights were active
in the area on the night of December 14, 1994. The call was transferred
to SECURITY, where Mr. Jones was kind enough to conduct a search of the
log book for the information. </FONT></FONT></P>

<P><FONT COLOR="#FFFF00"><FONT SIZE=-1>Jones said that the log book records
helicopter flights to or from the helipad at the Northside Hospital. </FONT></FONT></P>

<P><FONT COLOR="#FFFF00"><FONT SIZE=-1>&quot;Every flight coming in or
leaving this hospital is documented, they are logged in and logged out,&quot;

Jones said. &quot;We have to open the pad and prepare the fire extinguishers,
all that is recorded.&quot;</FONT></FONT></P>

<P><FONT COLOR="#FFFF00"><FONT SIZE=-1>Jones conducted a search through
the log book for all flights to or from the hospital in December of 1994.
He was informed that the date of December 14 was the day in question.</FONT></FONT></P>

<P><FONT COLOR="#FFFF00"><FONT SIZE=-1>&quot;There were no helicopter flights
to our helipad on that date,&quot; Jones said. &quot;The only listing for
helicopter flights to the Northside Hospital was on December 10 and December
23.&quot;</FONT></FONT></P>

<P><FONT COLOR="#FFFF00"><FONT SIZE=-1>The hospital itself does not have
a helicopter of its own, nor do any other hospitals in the area. Helicopter's
arriving at the Northside helipad are usually the 'Metro Lifeflight' unit
or the 'STAT' helicopter out of Pittsburgh.</FONT></FONT></P>

<P><FONT COLOR="#FFFF00"><FONT SIZE=-1>It was indicated that an unusual
sighting of an aerial object near Sampson Drive was being investigated,
and if a helicopter were to recover an accident victim from this area and
transport the person to another hospital instead of Northside.</FONT></FONT></P>

<P><FONT COLOR="#FFFF00"><FONT SIZE=-1>&quot;No, that wouldn't happen,&quot;
said the security officer at the hospital. &quot;If something happend on
Sampson drive, they would have been taken to one of the two local hospitals
via ambulance. If necessary, they would then be flown from there [the hospital]
elsewere, to Cleveland or wherever.&quot;</FONT></FONT></P>

<P><FONT COLOR="#FFFF00"><FONT SIZE=-1>The 'Northside Helicopter' theory
is squashed, but just because flights originating to or from the hospital
have been ruled out doesn't eliminate a helicopter scenario altogether.
The UFO situation in Trumbull County on December 14 may still be explainable
as a misidentified helicopter... but if so, such a helicopter would have
originated from someplace other than Northside. Even still, the helicopter
scenario strongly contradicts the event as we understand it from close
review of witness testimony, conflicting in both visual as well as audible
characteristics described by witnesses to the incident.</FONT></FONT></P>
