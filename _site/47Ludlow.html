the Southern Railroad found what some believed to be a flying saucer Tuesday

in diameter.</font></font><font face="Arial Narrow"><font size=+1></font></font>

who declined to be named, said, however, that he believed the disk more

<font face="Arial Narrow"><font size=+1>A big "aluminum disc" found Tuesday
in the Ludlow yards of the Southern Railroad prompted neighborhood speculation
and a visit from the Ludlow police chief and newspapermen. Officials concluded
the disc was an airplane wing tip removed from a freight car and left in
the yards as a practical joke.</font></font>

<font face="Arial Narrow"><font size=+1>A "flying saucer" was chased to
its lair or liar Tuesday in Ludlow.</font></font><font face="Arial Narrow"><font size=+1></font></font>
<p><font face="Arial Narrow"><font size=+1>For several hours Tuesday morning
rumors flew faster than the reported speed of the saucers which have been
seen or reported seen in nearly every state in the country.</font></font><font face="Arial Narrow"><font size=+1></font></font>
<p><font face="Arial Narrow"><font size=+1>Excitement ran high as residents
gathered to discuss the probability of one of the winged mysteryies. Rumors
that one of the discs was grounded and was being held by employees of the
Ludlow Roundhouse of the Southern Railway.<br>
<br>
Railroad officials said they had heard the same stories but were inclined
to discount their veracity.</font></font><font face="Arial Narrow"><font size=+1></font></font>
<p><font face="Arial Narrow"><font size=+1>So insistent did the stories
of a flying saucer grow that Chief Harvey Searp in company with newspaper
photographers made an official visit to the roundhouse.</font></font><font face="Arial Narrow"><font size=+1></font></font>
<p><font face="Arial Narrow"><font size=+1>Then it came out that the "saucer"
was just a practical joke that got out of hand.</font></font><font face="Arial Narrow"><font size=+1></font></font>
<p><font face="Arial Narrow"><font size=+1>Chief Searp said he learned
some of the employees of the night shift had picked up a piece of metal
wing from a dismantled plane which had fallen from a carload of scrap.</font></font><font face="Arial Narrow"><font size=+1></font></font>
<p><font face="Arial Narrow"><font size=+1>On the wing tip they chalked
"Half a flying saucer." The tale was cloaked in mystery and whispered phrases
about a "flying saucer" did the rest.</font></font></blockquote>

<p><b>PHOTOGRAPH ABOVE: </b>Appeared on PAGE ONE of Kentucky Post, July
8, 1947. Text:<i> Disc-concerting, no? Half of a flying saucer is what
jokers first called this airplane wingtip, which was found Monday night
in the Southern Railroad's Lulow coach yard. The "disc" rumor spread so
rapidly Tuesday that police and press investigated the report. Paul James,
Yowel pike, Boone county, a crane operator at the Southern yards, displays
the "broken saucer" above.</i>
