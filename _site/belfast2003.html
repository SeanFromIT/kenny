From the side of her house, she-along with three other witnesses (her mom, her sister and one of her friends)-observed a triangular-shaped formation of lights on one large object, thelights reportedly flashed in sequence and would simultaneously alternatein color from pinkish-red, blue, white to yellow. The triangular arrangementof lights were comprised of 4-or 5 lights with the peak of the trianglefacing downward, at the bottom</font></b><p><b><font size=+1>The witness described the lights flashing as if ina train or row of lights. "The lights were on the outer edge," she said,"assuming the lights that were flashing in sequence were along a triangularouter edge." She said this flashing effect was vastly different than thetwinkling of a star.</font></b><p><b><font size=+1>She said the colors would change but do so in a unanimousfashion, all red or all yellow, etc., and would flash along the outer edgeof the object in a slow sequence at first, then the flashing sequence escalatedin speed after several minutes into the sighting.</font></b><p><b><font size=+1>The witness first observed the object when taking herdog outside around 12:00 a.m. midnight. The object caught her attentiondue to its brightness in the sky. She said that the full moon and planetMars was visible from her residence (which has a good, unobstructed viewof the sky), and noted a distinction between the object, the full moonand Mars. She said that the UFO was not quite as big as a full moon fromher vantage point, but was less than 1/2 the size of the full moon fromher perspective. She said this was a very large object and that it hoveredin place for almost one hour at an elevation she estimated to be less than45 degrees above the horizon.</font></b><p><b><font size=+1>She said that her mother, who is skeptical about UFOs,decided to have her report the object because it seemed to be so unusual.The witness said that her sister is also skeptical but could not identifythe object, nor could her friend who she also had take a look. They viewedthe object, also looking at it through binoculars, until the object "wentfurther off" from its original location and the four observers discontinuedwatching because there was "nothing else that seemed to be going on."</font></b><p><b><font size=+1>The witness said the large triangular object was estimatedto have been 12-miles northeast of her location and situated above Belfast,Ohio (southern Highland County), hovering for a long time near Routes 73,Route 770 and Route 247.</font></b><p><b><font size=+1>When asked if the witness noted any unusual animalreaction, she said that coyotes were heard howling loudly during the timeof the sighting, and also the previous evening. She used the term "ridiculous"to characterize the number and volume of coyote howls that were heard.</font></b><p><b><font size=+1>The weather conditions at the time were clear skieswith a bright full moon.</font></b><p><b><font size=+2>INVESTIGATION</font></b><p><b><font size=+1>The Adams County Sheriff Department was contacted bytelephone (937-544-2314) to find out if anyone had reported a UFO sightingsometime around midnight this morning. The dispatcher taking the call wasinterested in the report, saying she lived near Belfast, but that the officehad received no calls on it. She took my number and said that it wouldbe posted in the office for future reference in the event of any UFO calls.</font></b><p><b><font size=+1>Next, the Highland County Sheriff's office was contactedat 937-393-1421 to find out if anyone had reported a UFO near Belfast,Ohio after midnight. The dispatcher said he checked the daily log and couldfind no mention of a UFO complaint.</font></b><p><b><font size=+2>COMMENT:</font></b><p><b><font size=+1>I view this witness as sincere and reliable. The locationof Belfast, Ohio is nearly 5-miles northwest of the Serpent Mound StateMemorial at Locust Grove, where a crop formation was discovered on August24. I notified Nancy Talbott of BLT Research (Cambridge, Massachusetts)of this present UFO report. Nancy had additional questions so the witnesswas called back and together we spoke further with the witness by 3-waytelephone conversation. Nancy Talbott also views the witness as credible.Additionally, the witness informs that her father -who was asleep at thetime and did not see the UFO- had just returned from the store as we weretalking on the phone and said that everyone at the store was talking about"a woman who came in and told of a 'UFO' seen last night." Mandy said shewill try to follow up on this to see if she can get additional informationas it might support her own account.</font></b><p><b><font size=+1>This UFO sighting is but one of many recent reportsoriginating from Southern Ohio in the past few weeks.
