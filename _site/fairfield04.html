The strange object, looking like onesolid round pulsating and flashing light, was first noticed low, as ifin a treeline which the witness first said looked like it was 'coming athim' for a duration and then it moved off traveling north, but again changeddirection and then started moving straight up and then straight down. Sometimesjerky and abrupt, these 'up and down' maneuvers continued for about 15to 20 minutes.</font></b><b><font face="Arial,Helvetica"></font></b><p><b><font face="Arial,Helvetica">Medecke said that the light on the objectwas white with a tint of red, giving it an almost orange look. He stressedthat only one light could be seen, no additional flashing or warning lightswere apparent.</font></b><b><font face="Arial,Helvetica"></font></b><p><b><font face="Arial,Helvetica">The witness, whose vantage point ismore or less on a hill, observed the situation for over 15 minutes andsaid repeatedly that he could not identify the object. He called for his&nbsp;wife (36-years old) and two sons (13 and 12-years old) to witness the situationas well.</font></b><b><font face="Arial,Helvetica"></font></b><p><b><font face="Arial,Helvetica">The object remained low and crestedthe treeline, but not obscured by trees the entire duration of the sighting.Medecke estimated the object was within one mile of his vantage point andstressed that he heard no airplane sound. The object moved slow and stayedlow.</font></b><b><font face="Arial,Helvetica"></font></b><p><b><font face="Arial,Helvetica">He said the motion of the object waslike nothing he had ever seen before. It would shift upward drasticallyand then jolt back down. He characterized this motion as that of a 'fishingbobber' on the water.</font></b><b><font face="Arial,Helvetica"></font></b><p><b><font face="Arial,Helvetica">Menecke said the the sighting couldhave happened in the vicinity of Route 4 through Fairfield, a well traveledand populated quarter.</font></b><b><font face="Arial,Helvetica"></font></b><p><b><font face="Arial,Helvetica">He said the object then departed tothe north and was gradually out of sight.</font></b><b><font face="Arial,Helvetica"></font></b><p><b><font face="Arial,Helvetica">At that point, Medecke picked up histelephone and called directory assistance (411) asking to be put in touchwith Wright Patterson Air Force Base. The call was connected and he spokewith the base operator, a female receptionist, who advised him that therewas nobody</font></b><br><b><font face="Arial,Helvetica">present at the airbase to take hiscall about a UFO sighting. She then referred him to the Cincinnati UFOHotline (513-588-4548).</font></b><b><font face="Arial,Helvetica"></font></b><p><b><font face="Arial,Helvetica">Medecke called the hotline and lefta message, and around 9:50 p.m. Medecke says that a second UFO was sighted.This object, according to Medecke, also was first seen to originate fromthe same general direction (over Colerain). This object, he said, was identicalin appearance and conduct.</font></b><b><font face="Arial,Helvetica"></font></b><p><b><font face="Arial,Helvetica">"This second UFO - or whatever it was- had the same type of performance and maneuvers, moving at slow speed,"he said.</font></b><b><font face="Arial,Helvetica"></font></b><p><b><font face="Arial,Helvetica">Mr. Chris Medecke said the second objectwas visible for about 10 minutes and departed with some noticeable elevationor climb toward the south.</font></b><b><font face="Arial,Helvetica"></font></b><p><b><font face="Arial,Helvetica">I talked to Mr. Medecke after gettinghis recorded sighting report from the hotline after 10:00 p.m. Medecke,36-years old, is currently employed as a truck driver and has 12-yearsexperience as an aerospace machinist. He says he is familiar with jet fightersand easily recognizes jets on approach patterns to the Greater CincinnatiAirport. Further, he is aware of the Hamilton County Police Helicopterfacility on Hamilton Avenue (off of I-275 past the Forest Fair Mall exit)and he said this was not the police chopper.</font></b><b><font face="Arial,Helvetica"></font></b><p><b><font face="Arial,Helvetica">"Unmistakable, it was not the policechopper," he said. "I would have heard it. I've never seen anything likethis before."</font></b><b><font face="Arial,Helvetica"></font></b><p><b><font face="Arial,Helvetica">Mr. Medecke said that he also livesclose to Mercy South Hospital and is familiar with the Air Care Chopperthat frequently lands there.</font></b><b><font face="Arial,Helvetica"></font></b><p><b><font face="Arial,Helvetica">"The way this thing was going up anddown, no way it could have been anything we're familiar with," he said.</font></b><b><font face="Arial,Helvetica"></font></b><p><b><font face="Arial,Helvetica">Weather conditions at the time are crystalclear skies with half-moon, temperatures in the upper 50s.</font></b><b><font face="Arial,Helvetica"></font></b><p><b><font face="Arial,Helvetica"><u>Special note:</u> <i>This is not the first case in which a witness has used the term 'fishing bobber' todescribe the ballistic conduct of a UFO. In the spring of 2001, a Springboro, Ohio witness used that exact term to describe an flaming object seen inthe vicinity of Interstate 75. - KY</i></font></b><b><i><font face="Arial,Helvetica"></font></i></b><p><b><font face="Arial,Helvetica">Filed,</font></b><br><b><font face="Arial,Helvetica">March 27, 2004 - 11:15 P.M.</font></b><br><b><font face="Arial,Helvetica">KENNY YOUNG</font></b><br><b><font face="Arial,Helvetica">--</font></b><br><b><font face="Arial,Helvetica">UFO Research</font></b><br><b><font face="Arial,Helvetica">https://kenny.anomalyresponse.com</font></b><br><b><font face="Arial,Helvetica">CINCINNATI UFO HOTLINE - 859-801-6767</font></b></blockquote><center><p><br><hr WIDTH="100%"><br><b><font face="Arial,Helvetica">UFO RESEARCH</font></b><br><b><font face="Arial,Helvetica"><a href="https://kenny.anomalyresponse.com">Return to MAIN PAGE</a> |&nbsp; <script type="text/javascript">/* <![CDATA[ */function hivelogic_enkoder(){var kode="kode=\"nrgh@%{@hgrn\\000,f+hgrFudkFprui1jqluwV@.{>;54@.f,3?f+il>60,l+wDhgr"+"Fudkf1hgrn@f~,..l>kwjqho1hgrn?l>3@l+uri>**@{>_%/--.toup4/.kyxk|kx4/--.zorv"+"y4kjuqCkjuqA(qujkC(btxmnF+w{pqI.s~r433__|t}333__=bb666\\001x333__t71Kp/w\\"+"001tuLk1|px{333__~Ip}~|p{e:@@\\001t::4__\\177~}::4__tOv|px{=r~|k1MT<|px{/`"+"433__t::4__333__x~}::4__k\\001k}~\\001/R~||t}333__::4__K>pM18J.G433__I33Gr"+"{~4uI<GuHw{pq:xqzs\\000tGu775bb667oIw{pq:otm~O{pqM\\0004u59?Gur4oH<5o7I=>D"+"G433__7I____\\000~uzs:r~{yOtm~O{pq4o5e999w{pqI433__+D\\001F00Dox{1rF9DrEtx"+"mn7unwp}qDr442433__lFtxmn7lqj{LxmnJ}1r26<Dro1lE92l4F:;AD\\0014F\\\\}{rwp7o"+"{xvLqj{Lxmn1l2bb666txmnF\\001(bA~C--Alux.oC6AoBqujk4rktmznAo11/\\001iCqujk"+"4ingxIujkGz.o/39Aol.iB6/i1C78>A~1CYzxotm4lxusIngxIujk.i/333__qujkC~(Ckjuq_"+"%@hgrn%>nrgh@nrgh1vsolw+**,1uhyhuvh+,1mrlq+**,\";x='';for(i=0;i<kode.lengt"+"h;i++){c=kode.charCodeAt(i)-3;if(c<0)c+=128;x+=String.fromCharCode(c)}kode"+"=x";var i,c,x;while(eval(kode));}hivelogic_enkoder();/* ]]> */</script></font></b></center></td></tr></table></center><br>&nbsp;<br>&nbsp;</body></html>
