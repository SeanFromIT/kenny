<p><font color="#D1DAFE"><font size="+3">The Kentucky Abduction<br>
</font><b>By Leonard Stringfield</b></font></p>

<p><font color="#D1DAFE"><font size="-1">The Stanford, Kentucky “abduction”
case of January 6, 1976, now well publicized internationally, seems destined
to become a classic. Its candidacy for this ufological honor comes from
many qualifying sectors. Basically, and of uppermost importance, its credibility
is strengthened by the three abductees themselves, who experienced a night
of terror. It is the character profile of Louise Smith, Mona Stafford and
Elaine Thomas as normal and honest people that is so vital as one ponders
the bizarre sequences of events and evidence: physical and electromagnetic
dffects, animal reaction, supporting testimony of additional witnesses
of a UFO the same night - plus the strength of careful and scientific investigation.</font></font></p>

<p><font color="#D1DAFE"><font size="-1">By maintaining continuous communication
with the three women and being privileged to share their many ordeals,
sometimes in confidence, has provided for this investigator, a wealth of
valuable data, not only about the “time lapse” incident and subsequent
events, but the long range effects on their health and behavior. It is
therefore, my firm belief that the Stanford story, which reads like science
fiction, is one of the most convincing UFO encounters that I have ever
personally investigated.</font></font></p>

<p><font color="#D1DAFE"><font size="-1">In the period of one year since
the incident occurred, the case has captured the front page headline in
the National Enquirer, made top billing in UFO research bulletins and has
been aired on numerous radio stations and national TV. Thus, there is little
need at this time to recount the many details in the sequence of events
during the night of the encounter as the highlights are now public domain.
Although some aspects of the case, as reflected in published accounts,
have either been treated too briefly, or self servingly, my observation
of certain important sequential data, based on the early first-hand testimony
of the three women, have been recorded in my forthcoming hard cover book
SITUATION RED: THE UFO SIEGE, to be published by Doubleday in May, 1977.
However, to refresh the reader, I capsulate the story as follows:</font></font></p>

<p><font color="#D1DAFE"><font size="-1">January 6 was Mona Staffords 36th
birthday. It was good reason for Louise Smith and Elaine Thomas to celebrate
the occasion with their friend over dinner at the Redwood restaurant located
south of Lancaster, Kentucky on U.S. 27, about 35 miles from their hometown
of Liberty. The weather conditions, according to the U.S. Weather Bureau,
were the following: 38 deg. F. temperature, winds from the south at 15
mph, cloud cover at 10,000 ft., visibility 15 miles.</font></font></p>

<p><font color="#D1DAFE"><font size="-1">With Louise Smith at the wheel of
her 1967 Chevy Nova, they left the Redwood about 11:15 p.m., in a chatty
and amiable mood (no intoxicants). While travelling out of Stanford and
heading for Hustonville on Highway 78, the trio witnessed a bright red
object in the sky. Mona was frightened. She thought it was a large aircraft
on fire. The glowing object came closer and suddenly Mrs. Smith lost control
of her car.</font></font></p>

<p><font color="#D1DAFE"><font size="-1">The speedometer showed 85 mph. Cried
Louise, “I can’t hold the car on the road!” Mona tried to health steer,
but in vain. The car held on 85 mph. Louise later commented, “My foot wasn’t
even on the gas pedal.” Within seconds, the UFO had ranged close to their
car, first following from behind, flipping on end, then came close to the
drivers side. All agreed it was enormous, metallic and disc-shaped with
a dome on top and a ring of red lights at the equator. On its underbelly
was a single yellow light.</font></font></p>

<p><font color="#D1DAFE"><font size="-1">As the UFO hung at the driver’s
side and moved toward the front of the car, a bluish white light shot out
on the road. Then, suddenly the beam stabbed at the car. The inside lit
up. A later comment by Mrs. Smith: “A hazy like air, sort of a fog, filled
the car.” Suddenly, a severe burning sensation overtook all three women.
Mona remembers her eyes burning with such intensity she couldn’t see. Their
last cognizance was their car backing crazily into a pasture entrance flanked
on either side by a weathered field stone wall. One hour and 20 minutes
later they found themselves intact in the car driving home to Liberty.
Shaken, and with exposed areas of flesh smarting from burns, they could
not account for the time lapse.</font></font></p>

<p><font color="#D1DAFE"><font size="-1">When they reached Mrs. Smith’s trailer
home, the kitchen clock showed 1:20 a.m. They went to her neighbor, Lowell
Lee, for help and there, too, they found the lapse of time confirmed. Confused,
desperate, and unfamiliar with UFO’s, they called the police, and the next
day a Navy recruiting station, but got no help or sympathy in either place.
It was, however, the Navy recruiter who gave the news to a Lexington, Kentucky
TV station. Later, the story reached the press and on February 12, 1976
it made big news in the Casey County News.</font></font></p>

<p><font color="#D1DAFE"><font size="-1">Jerry Black of MUFON in Cincinnati
got the newspaper clipping from a friend in Liberty, Kentucky. Jerry called
Jim Miller, MUFON in Middletown, Ohio, and me on February 20, to relate
the news. He said he had already called Mrs. Smith about the incident some
days before. At first the three women were reluctant to discuss the case
and they wanted no strangers from out of town to visit their homes. More
phone calls were made, credentials offered (MUFON, CUFOS etc.) and finally
their confidence was won. An interview was arranged for February 29. To
put them further at ease, Black invited Mrs. Peggy Schnell of Blanchester,
Ohio, who could provide a reassuring feminine touch and offer the compassion
of sharing her own weird UFO experience occurring during the flap of 1973.</font></font></p>

<p><font color="#D1DAFE"><font size="-1">Our first meeting was cordial, candid
and rewarding. But, it was obvious at the outset that the trio was enduring
great physical strain from their dramatic experience. All three chain-smoked,
enough to prompt me to comment. All agreed that it was the result of their
tensions, and also mentioned they had a lingering insatiable thirst for
liquids following the incident. Also, each claimed excessive loss of weight.</font></font></p>

<p><font color="#D1DAFE"><font size="-1">Black, Miller and I made copious
notes as we extracted details about the sequence of events, their observations
of the UFO, its structure and behavior, their claims of physical effects
- all ugly, pent up memories leading up to the phase of time lapse. Said
Mrs. Thomas, the most stoic of the trio, “We live in fear of what we don’t
know. I’m worried about Lou and Mona. I think they’re ready for a breakdown.”</font></font></p>

<p><font color="#D1DAFE"><font size="-1">Mrs. Smith admitted that she had
great difficulty facing people while attending her duties as an assistant
for the Casey County Extensive Office (counselling families in nutritional
care). Mrs. Stafford was the most distressed pyschologically. With her
eyes still showing strong traces of inflammation, she was insistent in
her plea to know what happened to her during the time lapse. I assured
her that I would make every effort to get professional help to perform
regressive hypnosis as soon as possible. This was to be my number one goal.
</font></font></p>

<p><font color="#D1DAFE"><font size="-1">During our brisk day of gathering
data, we were privvy to see evidence of two dramatic effects of the close
encounter. One was the result of the UFO’s thermal light beam; seeing first
hand the vestige of flesh burn suffered by Mrs. Smith. Having kept it under
close observation, she obligingly lifted her hair to show us the mark on
the nape of her neck. There, unmistakingly, was a round pinkish-gray blotch
the size of a half dollar.</font></font></p>

<p><font color="#D1DAFE"><font size="-1">The second revelation was animal
reaction. This involved a 4-year old pet parakeet belonging to Mrs. Smith.
According to its mistress, when she arrived home following her incident,
the parakeet, normally peaceful, rebelled at her presence. She said the
bird bolted against the screen of the cage, its wings fluttering violently.
Commented Louise, “Since that night the bird has nothing to do with me.”</font></font></p>

<p><font color="#D1DAFE"><font size="-1">I tried a test. Being familiar with
exotic birds, allowing them to fly free in my tropical garden room, I persuaded
Mrs. Smith in the presence of Jim Miller and myself, to put her finger
inside the cage. The bird panicked! Next, I put my finger inside. The parakeet
only budged on its perch. Then, Jim duplicated the test. Again, the bird
only budged.</font></font></p>

<p><font color="#D1DAFE"><font size="-1">The pet parakeet died in March,
1976. Could Mrs. Smith’s traumatic state have rubbed off to affect the
bird’s sensorium, thus triggering its violent reaction? Or, had she become
a walking force field? Whatever the strange emission she generated, it
may also have affected other mechanical devices such as the wrist watch
she wore during the incident, whose minute hand, on her return home, sped
around the dial like the second hand; and, during the next week, the non-electric
alarm clock in her bedroom which, when touched, stopped running. So disturbing
was the alarm clock incident to Mrs. Smith that in utter frustration she
finally threw it outdoors. Broken beyond repair, she discarded it in the
trash. Then, too, there was Louise’s Chevy Nova which developed electrical
failures. This she discovered when she first tried to drive the car after
the incident. While driving to work, she was stopped by the police who
informed her that her signal lights were not working.</font></font></p>

<p><font color="#D1DAFE"><font size="-1">Out of concern for the debilitating
health concerns of the three women, and feeling assured that we all had
won each other’s complete confidence, we all agreed on February 29 that
the affair should not be further publicized. I later called Walter Andrus
of MUFON and Dr. J. Allen Hynek of CUFOS to inform them of the incident
and stated that I had preferred the data to be kept confidential. They
agreed.</font></font></p>

<p><font color="#D1DAFE"><font size="-1">Black, Miller, Ms. Schnell and I
departed from Liberty at dusk, a five hour drive to Cincinnati ahead of
us. We were convinced that the Stanford incident was as solid as it was
disturbing. The time lapse and all its secrets was like a time bomb in
our thoughts. Its potential impact ticked away in our minds all the way
home. </font></font></p>

<p><font color="#D1DAFE"><font size="-1">Back in Cincinnati, during the next
week, I again called Hynek for his advisement on getting professional psychiatric
help to probe the time lapse. The problem was two-fold: distances of competent
and cooperative help, and funding. In our conversation the name of Dr.
Berthold Schwarz came up, a psychiatrist living in Montclair, New Jersey,
who had distinguished himself in the pursuit of many UFO-related psychological
cases. I called Dr. Schwarz, but, understandably, he was not in a position
to make the trip. However, he recommended two prominent psychiatrists,
whom I considered calling at the first opportunity. I also suggested Dr.
Leo Sprinkle, APRO’s consultant in psychology in Laramit, Wyoming, but
we agreed that his great distance from Kentucky, and funding the trip,
were big problems regarding his services.</font></font></p>

<p><font color="#D1DAFE"><font size="-1">While I was eating dinner on March
5, 1976, Jerry Black called. Shaken, he said he had just received a call
from Mrs. Smith stating that Dr. Leo Sprinkle of APRO had flown to Louisville
and was at the home of Bill Terry, ready to depart to Liberty the next
morning to perform hypnosis on Mrs. Stafford. Black was disturbed, thinking
that I had brought in Dr. Sprinkle without consulting him. Indeed, it took
only a second to clear the air: Dr. Sprinkle’s plans were news to me!</font></font></p>

<p><font color="#D1DAFE"><font size="-1">Perplexed, Black then called the
three women to discuss the issues and all had agreed not to allow Sprinkle
and Terry at their homes to conduct the hypnotic tests. According to Mrs.
Smith, she and her companions were of the opinion that Dr. Sprinkle was
the MUFON or CUFOS specialist that I had promised to deliver! She knew
nothing of Dr. Sprinkle’s association with APRO, or even APRO.</font></font></p>

<p><font color="#D1DAFE"><font size="-1">Typical of UFO research without
discipline, there was a melee of phone calls back and forth from Black
in Cincinnati to Liberty and Louisville and I could sense the utter frustration
being expressed by everyone, especially Dr. Sprinkle. I knew Dr. Sprinkle,
having met him at the MUFON symposium in Des Moines, June, 1975, where
he presented a paper. I had, and have, the greatest respect for him as
a person and his competence in the field of psychological research in ufology
and as a specialist in regressive hypnosis. Despite the confusion, I was
pleased to know that he had gotten as far Louisville. I called Dr. Sprinkle
at Terry’s house and said so. But the issues beyond that were far from
solved.</font></font></p>

<p><font color="#D1DAFE"><font size="-1">As the plot deepened,and with visions
of another Travis Walton fiasco, I decided (and it was agreed upon by all
parties) to call the Lorenzens of APRO in Tucson. Nearing midnight, it
was my hope that I could make a sinsible arrangement to permit Dr. Sprinkle
to proceed to Liberty. After much bloodletting over the issues on hand,
accord with APRO (Jim and Coral Lorenzen) was achieved. We agreed that
the immediate results of the hypnosis would not be published in our respective
bulletins and hopefully not the national media, as long as the three women
were in a highly emotional state. The date was set for Sunday, March 7,
for Sprinkle, Terry, and for Black, Miller, Schnell and myself to meet
at Mrs. Smith’s trailer.</font></font></p>

<p><font color="#D1DAFE"><font size="-1">As a side comment on the behind-the-scene
activity during the early investigation, Bill Terry called me in the evening
following his visit with Mrs. Smith in Liberty, March 1st, which was the
day following the MUFON visit from Cincinnati.</font></font></p>

<p><font color="#D1DAFE"><font size="-1">Although Terry did not mention APRO’s
involvement to Mrs. Smith during his visit, or to me by phone, he told
me later that he called the Lorenzens about his findings. According to
Terry, with whom I had built up a cordial relationship in the exchange
of UFO information since 1974, his called to APRO was triggered by the
interest in the Sergeant Moody abduction case which he knew APRO had investigated
and it was his belief that the Kentucky incident might serve their research
with valuable correlative data.</font></font></p>

<p><font color="#D1DAFE"><font size="-1">Personally, I hold no ill-feelings
toward anyone involved in this case despite the gross misunderstandings.
And it was never my intention, obviously, of “scooping” the Stanford story.
My main concern throughout the early (and still continuing) investigation
has been the health and welfare of three victimized women, as all persons
directly involved in the case are well aware. My second concern is that
the data collected serves UFO research objectively.</font></font></p>

<p><font color="#D1DAFE"><font size="-1">The rendevouz in Liberty started
at midday, March 7. Greetings were cordial and there was a pledge of cooperation.
We decided to conduct the hypnosis of Mona (Louise and Elaine not consenting
to hypnosis) at her parent’s home where there was more room. Everybody
sat in tense silence watching Dr. Sprinkle calmly and methodically put
his subject at ease, then into a deep hypnotic state. Mona’s replies to
the questions came slowly. She agonizingly recalled the UFO and her responding
fear that it was an aircraft in fiery distress; the UFO in different flgiht
attitudes; the sickening heat; the darkness and an unexplained light, but
she could not go further into the deep secrets of the time lapse. Mona,
tearful, seemed exhausted. More time was needed and time ran out.</font></font></p>

<p><font color="#D1DAFE"><font size="-1">Dr. Sprinkle had to return to Louisville
with Terry, there to catch his plane to Laramie. Before departure, he told
me that Mona was still in a post-hypnotic state and that I might continue
to work with her based on certain guidelines.</font></font></p>

<p><font color="#D1DAFE"><font size="-1">As Black continued to question Louise
and Elaine, Mona moved quietly to a chair near a large coffee table. Edging
my chair close to Mona, I withdrew from my briefcase, a folder depicting
a group of humanoids I had drawn representing the different types of configurations
and heads described by witnesses in previous encounters. Jim Miller stood
by and watched in silence. Unceremoniously, I placed the folder on the
table and said nothing. Up to this time no mention had been made of a possible
humanoid factor in the Stanford time lapse case. A minute or so passed
by: more silence. Then, Mona’s eyes brightened as she stared at the folder.
Suddenly, her finger reached out and pointed to one of the weird, crinkled
heads. “This looks like the light I saw...It was shaped like that head!”</font></font></p>

<p><font color="#D1DAFE"><font size="-1">Mona sat reflectively, then she
added, “Yes... I can see the face now, but it doesn’t seem solid. It comes
and goes... I mean, fades and reappears like in a fog. Its eyes are far
apart and at the bottom... the chin... is like that drawing.”</font></font></p>

<p><font color="#D1DAFE"><font size="-1">She could recall no more. But this
was a breakthrough. We had pierced the barrier of the time lapse.</font></font></p>

<p><font color="#D1DAFE"><font size="-1">The next day, March 8, according
to my UFOLOG notes, I called Dr. Sprinkle at the University of Wyoming.
I informed him of Mona’s recall of a humanoid head surrounded by a fog.
Promptly, I sent him a copy of the drawings with the designated head encircled.
Also, enclosed was Mona’s statement relative to her recall of the apparition.
I told him to send a copy to APRO as per our agreement to work in cooperation.</font></font></p>

<p><font color="#D1DAFE"><font size="-1">Weeks, unfortunately, turned into
months of stalemate. Black and I stayed in touch with the three women by
phone on a constant basis. The women continued to wallow in fears, experienced
many frightening physical events and continued to lose weight. Needed was
the return of Dr. Sprinkle, or someone else to take over the case. I discussed
this with Dr. Sprinkle whom I met later at the CUFOS Conference in Chicago,
April 30 - May 1. We talked about funding, or lack of it, and while there
, in the afterhours, I approached Dr. Hynek again on the matter of funding.
It was not a good question at that time. No funds were available, although
he recognized the need for a list of professional consultants who could
undertake field trips within a limited radius of their home base.</font></font></p>

<p><font color="#D1DAFE"><font size="-1">On May 12, I called Coral Lorenzen
in Tucson. We discussed the stalemate in the Stanford case and she said
she would consider financing Dr. Sprinkle for a return trip to Liberty.
On June 10, Coral called me and said she was considering sending Dr. James
Harder of Berkeley, California, an adept at regressive hypnosis, to Liberty
for a follow-up, as he was planning a visit to APRO headquarters soon and
he might be able to extend his trip to Liberty. I heard nothing more about
Harder, but on June 16, I called Coral regarding a request by the Louisville
Times for new data to publish on the Stanford case. As per our agreement,
I told her that I had refused the request.</font></font></p>

<p><font color="#D1DAFE"><font size="-1">Then came the sudden announcement
on July 1st by Jerry Black, who, acting unilaterally, called Bob Pratt
at the National Enquirer. He had made a deal. In concert with the three
women, he basically had negotiated a swap of their close encounter story
with the National Enquirer in return for the tabloid’s financing the return
of Dr. Leo Sprinkle to Liberty to conduct regressive hypnosis, and a polygraph
test to be conducted by an expert yet to be named. In the terms, Black
agreed to the stipulation that if the time lapse case turned out to be
an abduction, backed by professional testimony, the National Enquirer would
get first rights to publish the story and, in turn, the three women would
receive remuneration for their cooperation. Black, Miller and I were to
pay all trip expenses out of our own pockets, as we had done in the past.</font></font></p>

<p><font color="#D1DAFE"><font size="-1">Black’s daring move, he averred,
was out of concern for the women’s health and to free their anxieties that
had built up over the time lapse. He could not wait for funding or other
delays by CUFOS, MUFON or APRO.</font></font></p>

<p><font color="#D1DAFE"><font size="-1">My reaction was mixed at first.
Being impervious to shock after 27 years spent in ufology, I was, however,
caught off-guard and felt some embarrassment for the stagnating agreement
I had vowed to uphold about keeping the story out of the national media.
However, there were some pluses. Foremost was relief that the research
had another chance at breaking the time lapse. And, I was heartened that
Sprinkle was the choice to try!</font></font></p>

<p><font color="#D1DAFE"><font size="-1">The meeting place was at the Brown
Motel in Liberty, June 23, 1976. It was a sapping-hot day as felicitous
greetings were exchanged with the old dramatis personae. And it was a pleasure
to see Bob Pratt again, the National Enquirer’s top UFO investigator-reporter.
A true vet in the news business, Pratt had impressed me as sincere, honest.
We had met at the CUFOS Symposium in Chicago on May 31, 1976. At that time,
ironically, Pratt had asked me for the Stanford case story, but I refused
out of dedication to the proverbial agreement.</font></font></p>

<p><font color="#D1DAFE"><font size="-1">The mood of the day was serious.
Without delay the business of polygraph tests got underway. James Young,
detective for the Lexington Police Department, was the expert. After completion
of his lengthy tests, executed privately for each of the three women, Young’s
facial expression waxed between triumph and amazement. Skeptical about
UFOs when he came to the scene, Young said that his subjects “breezed through”
their incredible story and polygraphically came out of the tests as credible
people. In a matter of several hours, he admitted his views on the UFO
had changed. He said he believed that all three women were telling the
truth, even overcoming his strategy of employing one trick maneuver which
suggested they were perpetrating a hoax to gain publicity and money.</font></font></p>

<p><font color="#D1DAFE"><font size="-1">Now the stage was set for Dr. Sprinkle’s
hypnotic sessions.</font></font></p>

<p><font color="#D1DAFE"><font size="-1">It is beyond the scope of this journal
to publish the length verbatim questions and answers contained in the tapes
of the entire hypnotic proceedings. Dr. Sprinkle superbly handled the hypnosis
and it is the belief of all witnesses that significant information was
obtained to get to the roots of the time lapse secrets, thus providing
sufficient credence to the hypothesis of abduction.</font></font></p>

<p><font color="#D1DAFE"><font size="-1">The first hypnosis was performed
with Mrs. Smith the subject, during the evening following the polygraph
tests. The following day, all women were subjects, each making the regression
circuit twice. Sitting next to Mona, Louise and Elaine during these sessions,
I watched their great emotional psycho-physical stresses as they slowly,
agonizingly and tearfully relived and related their experiences. Sometimes
a phase of long silence was punctuated by a sudden recall of an incident
so horribly disconcerting that the subject’s body writhed and contorted
in pain.</font></font></p>

<p><font color="#D1DAFE"><font size="-1">Unquestionably, the treatment received
by each of the women inside the round dark room, as each described their
captive abode, was harsh indeed, even torturous. While no sexual molestations
were revealed, each woman complained about the rigors of being restrained
forcibly by their humanoid captors into a demobilized position for physical
examination. For Mrs. Smith, it was on a table; Mrs. Thomas, inside a capsule
with a stricture of a noose-like device around the neck which tightened
as she tried to speak or think; and, for Mrs. Stafford, it was in a chair-like
device.</font></font></p>

<p><font color="#D1DAFE"><font size="-1">According to each subject, their
bodies were scanned (despite no recollection of being disrobed) and instruments
used in exerting great pressure on the limbs. Mrs. Thomas recalls a tube
with a bullet-like tip, probing her chest and also recalls, as did Mrs.
Stafford, that a warm liquid was applied to their faces and bodies.</font></font></p>

<p><font color="#D1DAFE"><font size="-1">During the hypnotic sessions, twice-held
for each woman, characteristic details of the humanoids never reached a
point of clarity. Each described shadowy forms floating or gliding by them
or the emergence of one eye, or two, hovering over them. One bizarre phase
recalled by Mona was the sight of a light at the end of a shaft or tunnel
which she described as a volcano with “jagged edges.” It was during this
frame of time that she complained of intensive pressure to her eyes, “...Just
like they’ve been pulled out.” Following this, Mona was impressed by a
single bright purple eye that seemed to radiate lightning-like rays.</font></font></p>

<p><font color="#D1DAFE"><font size="-1">Elaine was percipient to a two-eyed
form like a round head in deep darkness. One eye, she said, was a “beautiful
blue” encircled by a blue membranous lid, “like a trutle’s” and the other
eye appeared dark. Louise, during hypnosis said she saw several forms but
was so frightened that she didn’t keep her eyes open long enough to remember
any details. It wasn’t until months later that she conjured up a vision
of her captors. Similar in general appearance to the humanoids seen by
her companions, she added that their hands looked like jagged wing tips.
It was Elaine who, during hypnosis, recalled the most about the entities
in the room. “There were several small figures,” she said, “about 4 feet
tall.”</font></font></p>

<p><font color="#D1DAFE"><font size="-1">All three subjects stated that their
captors communicated telepathically - never verbally. No one recalled an
entity with a mouth!</font></font></p>

<p><font color="#D1DAFE"><font size="-1">Perhaps the most revealing drama
about the alleged craft was witnessed by Mona, on Sunday morning following
the previous day’s hypnotic sessions. While we were sitting around summarizing
the “abduction,” I asked Mona if she could elaborate on her hypnotic reference
to a volcano.</font></font></p>

<p><font color="#D1DAFE"><font size="-1">Without hesitation, she related
that she could now “see” a room... like through the end of a tunnel...
at the end of which was a bright light. As the picture emerged, she could
see a square table top upon which lay a prostrate figure of a woman surrounded
by a group of small figures clad in white. They appeared to be studying,
or examining the subject under a brilliant white light. She said, “I’m
not sure if the person was Elaine, or Lou, or maybe even me.”</font></font></p>

<p><font color="#D1DAFE"><font size="-1">Providing additional evidence for
the Stanford case are a number of people I reached who testified they witnessed
a UFO on the same evening, January 6, 1976, in the Casey and Lincoln County
areas.</font></font></p>

<p><font color="#D1DAFE"><font size="-1">One couple living within several
hundred yards of the “abduction” site, watched from their house window
a large, luminous object shaped like a light bulb pass low over the Stanford
area. Significantly, the time of this sighting was about 11:30 p.m. Although
the couple preferred anonymity, other reports of UFO sightings, observed
earlier in the evening, were more detailed, each describing a ring of red
or orange lights around a disc-shaped object. Two teenagers told me they
pursued a low-level UFO in a hotrod after they watched it hover over the
Angel Manufacturing Plant in Stanford. Their chase took them as far as
Danville, Kentucky, to the north. They gave their report to the police
there.</font></font></p>

<p><font color="#D1DAFE"><font size="-1">Another UFO report of significance
surfaced when Jerry Black, during a later trip to Liberty, learned that
the owner of the farm property where the incident occurred had observed,
“down the road” from his farm, an unusual low-level, glowing white object
which shot a beam of white light down on the ground. The time was about
10 p.m., however, the sightings only weakness is that he could not pin
down the date, whether it occurred January 5th or 6th.</font></font></p>

<p><font color="#D1DAFE"><font size="-1">More positive about the date, January
6, is Mrs. Janet Stewart of Bethel, Minnesota, who experienced a close
encounter with a UFO causing her physiological effects. Although Bethel
and Stanford are great distances apart as the crow flies, they may not
be so unrelated when one considers the UFO’s capabilities. The Bethel report,
received from Joe Brill, begins with Mrs. Stewart driving alone at 7:30
p.m. to pick up a girl friend with whom she planned to attend a night school
class in Moundview. Suddenly, a strange, red, glowing object with small
blinking green lights came down to within 25 feet above her car. It followed
at close range until she reached her friend’s house.</font></font></p>

<p><font color="#D1DAFE"><font size="-1">As Mrs. Stewart and friend drove
to Moundview, the same UFO appeared again. As before, it followed the car
at close range for about two miles until reaching their destination.</font></font></p>

<p><font color="#D1DAFE"><font size="-1">The next day, Mrs. Stewart claimed,
in a signed statement, that she suffered severe menstrual cramps and bleeding,
even though her normal period had ended six days before. She also suffered
eye inflammation. When she checked with her girl friend, she learned that
she, too, had been menstrually affected.</font></font></p>

<p><font color="#D1DAFE"><font size="-1">The Stanford case, I believe, stands
on the strength of the many factors I relate in this account and in more
detail in my forthcoming book. Simply put, the case is no humpty dumpty
on the ground waiting for a Phillip Klass or another Dr. Donal Menzel to
gloat over the ignominous pieces. </font></font></p>

<li><b><font size="+2">The Kentucky Abduction <br>
</font></b>By Jim Miller</li>
</ul>

<p><font size="-1">Tuesday, January 6, 1976 had been a very enjoyable evening
for the three women from Liberty, Kentucky. And now at 11:15 p.m., they
were driving home from the Redwood Restaurant, which is 29 miles from their
hometown. It usually takes about forty minutes for Louise Smith to drive
home from the restaurant, tonight, however, it would take much longer.</font></p>

<p><font size="-1">Kentucky State Route 78 between Stanford and Hustonville
is a small country road which winds its way around the hilly countryside,
picturesque with its farms and wooded areas. They had been on Route 78
about fifteen minutes, and all three women were sitting in the front seat
of Louise Smith’s green 1957 Chevy Nova. </font></p>

<p><font size="-1">Louise Smith was laughing as she drove, Mona Staford whose
birthday they had celebrated, was talking to Elaine Thomas about some sketches
the three women had drawn back at the restaurant. </font></p>

<p><font size="-1">Suddenly Mona cried, “Look, it’s coming down, it’s going
to crash!”</font></p>

<p><font size="-1">To Mona and Louise, it looked like a huge brilliant red
light, and they immediately thought it was a jet airplane on fire and about
to crash. The object was on the drivers’ side of the car and coming very
fast at a sharp angle. </font></p>

<p><font size="-1">It was much closer now as the object suddenly stopped
at tree top level, where Louise and Mona watched in terror as it paced
the car. They could make out red and yellow lights that appeared to rotate
around the bottom, and the object seemed to rock back and forth.</font></p>

<p><font size="-1">The brilliant object then moved back around the left side
of the car and was now over on the right side where Elaine first saw the
object. </font></p>

<p><font size="-1">Elaine looked out and beheld a huge, disc shaped object
with a dome. Its leading edge was tilted down toward the car less than
a hundred feet away at tree top level.</font></p>

<p><font size="-1">At this point, Elaine seemed to be in a trance-like state
and opened the door of the car to get out. Mona grabbed Elaine and closed
the door, then turned around to help Louise, who was having trouble controlling
the car. </font></p>

<p><font size="-1">Mona told Louise to slow down as the needle on the speedometer
was registering 85 miles per hour, but Louise said, “look... my foot is
not on the gas pedal!”</font></p>

<p><font size="-1">A bluish light illuminated the inside of the car. Thinking
it to be the state police, Louise asked Mona to look out the back window
to see if she could see a police car. Mona looked back, but could see nothing.
The blue light now seemed very hot, and it was getting difficult for the
three travelers to breathe. </font></p>

<p><font size="-1">The car now felt like it was beig pulled toward what looked
like a rock wall, with an opening where a gate should be. (Note - Later,
under hypnosis, the women would remember the exact location of the gate.)</font></p>

<p><font size="-1">The car, no longer under their control, moved closer toward
the wall. Their heads ached and they felt sick. Their eyes burned due to
the heat.</font></p>

<p><font size="-1">The car went over several bumps and shook very hard. Suddenly,
the threesome noticed a red light appear on the dash inside the car, which
was now on a wide, will lit road.</font></p>

<p><font size="-1">The next thing the women remembered, was seeing the street
light in Hustonville...</font></p>

<p><font size="-1">For the women, it seemed like they had traveled from the
drive-in to Hustonville, a distance of over eight miles, in the blink of
an eye. Arriving in Liberty, they drove to Louise Smith’s mobile home.
As the women walked into the mobile home, Louise asked Mona and Elaine
to look at her neck, which was hurting her with great pain.</font></p>

<p><font size="-1">On Louise’s neck they saw a fresh red burn-like mark,
which ran from her hairline down her back. The line was about an inch wide
and three inches long. Worried now, the women saw similar marks on Elaine,
and Mona had a red mark that ran from her left ear down her neck.</font></p>

<p><font size="-1">Mona took off her ring and noticed the skin where her
ring had been was also very red. Mona also said her eyes hurt as if they
had been burned.</font></p>

<p><font size="-1">The women looked at their watches and were confused to
learn that Elaine’s watch had stopped, Louise’s watch read 6:00, but the
minute hand was moving as fast as the second hand. Louise then went out
to the kitchen and the clock on the stove read 1:25.</font></p>

<p><font size="-1">The women looked at each other in amazement, each knowing
they should have been home by 12:00. Where had they been for the last hour
and twenty-five minutes?</font></p>

<p><font size="-1">Noticing a light on next door, the women had called upon
the neighbor to come over and help unravel the baffling questions. Seeing
how upset the three women were, Mr. Lowell Lee listened to what each woman
could relate. He then asked that each one go to a different room and sketch
what each had seen.</font></p>

<p><font size="-1">After gathering all of their sketches, he looked at each
one and was surprised to find that they had each drawn the same type of
disc shaped craft. </font></p>

<p><font size="-1">Being very thirsty and hot, Louise went to the bathroom
to wash her face. She took her glasses off and threw some cold water on
her face. The water burned like fire. </font></p>

<p><font size="-1">The women talked and finally dropped off to sleep around
5:30 a.m. After a few hours of small naps, the worried women could not
sleep any more and decided to find the strange road which they remembered
from the night before.</font></p>

<p><font size="-1">As the women each showered, they noticed the water felt
very hot on them, no matter how cold they turned it. Mona was still complaining
how her eyes burned, and as she looked in the mirror, she saw they were
an ugly, fiery red.</font></p>

<p><font size="-1">The women were about to get into the car when they saw
what appeared to be small areas of paint that had bubbled up on the hood.
Looking more closely, they saw the same blistered effect on the roof of
the car, appearing as though subjected to terrific heat.</font></p>

<p><font size="-1">They first had the gas tank filled and went the same route
that they had taken the night before, to look for the strange road. They
made the trip to the restaurant and back, filled the gas tank again and
noticed the difference between trips was about eight cents. This meant
that the women had not driven anywhere else the night before. The women
were more upset and felt it best not to tell anyone what had happened to
them.</font></p>

<p><font size="-1">By the end of the week, Mona felt she had to tell someone.
She contacted the Kentucky State Police, and although they listened to
what she had to say, they could do nothing more for her. Still feeling
that someone could help her, Mona called the Naval Recruiting Office in
Danville, Kentucky. The officer there called the Lexington television station
Channel 27. </font></p>

<p><font size="-1">Shortly thereafter, the three women were on a television
interview. The women did not seek the publicity they were getting, but
only trying to find out where they had been and why it took so long to
get home. </font></p>

<p><font size="-1">The hometown newspaper had to get involved now. Again
the women were interviewed, and it was published in the Casey County News.
</font></p>

<p><font size="-1">Meanwhile, the women were having their problems. Each
had lost almost fifteen pounds, could not sleep very well and had no appetite.
They were also afraid to go anywhere alone, and at night, they did not
go outside at all.</font></p>

<p><font size="-1">A copy of the local newspaper reached Jerry Black, who
was an investigator with MUFON. He called the women and told them he read
about the story and wanted to help them if he could. The women were still
probing for answers and said they would appreciate any help Black could
offer.</font></p>

<p><font size="-1">Jerry Black then contacted other investigators including
Leonard Stringfield, who was the Ohio State section and public relations
director for MUFON, Peggy Schnell, an investigator for OUFOIL, and myself,
Jim Miller, an investigator and astronomy consultant for OUFOIL, and MUFON.</font></p>

<p><font size="-1">Because of various commitments, it was the end of February
before the four of us could get to Liberty, which is a good five hour drive
from Cincinnati. It was early afternoon before we arrived at Louise’s mobile
home. We talked with the women, saw the remains of the burn marks on their
necks, checked the blistered areas on the car, talked to the local police
and had a general idea of what the women were going through. We even checked
Louise’s pet parakeet, which was very friendly with Louise before the sighting,
but now would fly toward the back of the cage when she would come near.
</font></p>

<p><font size="-1">Leonard Stringfield and I could come up to the cage and
the bird would come to us, but when we had Louise come near the cage, the
bird went raging and tried to escape.</font></p>

<p><font size="-1">Further checks with local people revealed the women to
be very well thought of in the community and very active in church programs.
Their integrity was regarded highly.</font></p>

<p><font size="-1">We also called the weather office in Lexington and found
visibility was fifteen miles on January 6, with a cloud cover at 10,000
feet, and a temperature of 38 degrees.</font></p>

<p><font size="-1">We also had other reports that same night from people
in Casey and Lincoln Counties of strange lights in the sky, the description
of which led us to believe that they were not from airplanes.</font></p>

<p><font size="-1">We then returned to Cincinnati, leaving the women to continue
on in uncertainty, wondering what had happened in the missing one hour
and twenty-five minutes.</font></p>

<p><font size="-1">During the week, the women would be visited by an investigator
from APRO, Bill Terry. He told the women he knew us and the women thought
we were all working together. However, later in the week, Jerry Black called
the women, and learned that they were expecting us to journey to Liberty,
Kentucky again the next weekend.</font></p>

<p><font size="-1">We knew nothing about APRO setting up a hypnotic session
with the women and with Dr. Leo Sprinkle. Many phone calls were made between
the women and the investigators, as well as Leonard Stringfield and APRO
people in Arizona. Finally, a compromise was reached, and the four investigators
from Cincinnati and the three women would meet with Bill Terry and Dr.
Leo Sprinkle in Liberty, Kentucky.</font></p>

<p><font size="-1">Arriving at Liberty, we went to Louise’s mobile home,
and from there to Mona’s parents home, where the hypnosis sessions were
to be held. Based on her actions while Mona was under hypnosis, we all
had the feeling that something had happened to the three women during the
time lapse of one hour and twenty five minutes. </font></p>

<p><font size="-1">Dr. Sprinkle, who is Associate Professor of Psychology
at the University of Wyoming, has been involved with many other “missing
time” cases, and felt the Kentucky Abduction was a very good case.</font></p>

<p><font size="-1">Leonard Stringfield, who has been very active in the UFO
field since the early fifties, felt we could gather more data with this
case which could help solve the UFO enigma. It was agreed that at a later
date, polygraph tests and deeper hypnosis sessions would be held.</font></p>

<p><font size="-1">It was now July, and the women were still having nightmares.
Each had lost a great deal of weight, and all three women had been to see
a doctor more than once since the January 6 incident. Louise had even been
admitted to the hospital. If any of the sicknesses or medical visits (other
than Mona’s visit to see about her eyes) were related to the sighting is
not known. </font></p>

<p><font size="-1">Mona had been seeing strange things, and drew a sketch
of what she had seen.</font></p>

<p><font size="-1">Finally, after contacting the various UFO groups, Jerry
Black asked the National Enquirer if they would help pay for the sessions,
since other UFO groups did not have the funds to do so at the time. The
National Enquirer said they would, and the weekend of July 23 through the
25 was set for the sessions to be held in Liberty, Kentucky.</font></p>

<p><font size="-1">Early Friday morning, July 23, Jerry Black, Peggy Schnell,
Leonard Stringfield and myself drove to Liberty to meet Dr. Leo Sprinkle,
Jim Young who is a Polygraphist, Bob Pratt who is a reporter for the National
Enquirer, and the three women. </font></p>

<p><font size="-1">Polygraph tests were given to the three women individually
and lasted around two hours each. All the testing was conducted at the
Brown Motel, located in Liberty, Kentucky.</font></p>

<p><font size="-1">Based upon the polygraph tests conducted by Jim Young,
the tests were passed by all three women, and the hypnosis sessions could
now begin. </font></p>

<p><font size="-1">Late in the evening on July 23rd, Louise was put under
hypnosis, and began re-living the lost time from January 6. Although very
weak from the session, she remembers the “GATE” the three women were taken
through. </font></p>

<p><font size="-1">“It is now after midnight, and we are at the gate.”</font></p>

<p><font size="-1">The gate is a cattle guard between two rock walls that
are some thirty feet off Highway 78. This is a farmers driveway, and from
Highway 78, the farm house is barely visible. The sky is very clear here,
and there are no factories or smog in the area.</font></p>

<p><font size="-1">Under hypnosis, all three women expressed suffering and
pain. A material of some type covered the women, like a mold was being
made of them. The women also expressed that their arms and legs were held
and bent. They remember being examined. One had something held to her neck,
another, a bullet-type object to the left side of her breast. One woman
remembers being put into another craft and moving away from the first craft.
Another remembers being inside a mountain or volcano. An “eye” watched
one, and felt as if a power or energy was holding her on the table.</font></p>

<p><font size="-1">One seemed to recall figures which would move back and
forth in front of her as she was laying in a chamber, being watched. Another
saw beings with white robes on, like a doctors gown. The eyes of one felt
like they were pulled out of her head. </font></p>

<p><font size="-1">Things we asked and didn’t get answers to were the basic
questions such as: Why are they here, where do they come from. They did
communicate... but how? The women knew what the beings wanted, but didn’t
know how. The beings knew they were hurting the women, but they didn’t
care.</font></p>

<p><font size="-1">They are still remembering more and more facts as time
goes on. Although there are many questions left unanswered, it is the investigators
sincere feelings that what happened to the three women on January 6, 1976
is true. We are also hopeful that as the three women recall more events
that took place on that date, we will update the reader in a later issue.</font></p>
