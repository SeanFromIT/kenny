<P><FONT COLOR="#FFFF00"><FONT SIZE=-1>APRIL 21, 2:30 p.m. <BR>
Phone call placed to Lieutenant O'Brein, Public Affairs Officer of the
Ohio Army National Guard (614-889-7000). An inquiry was placed in regards
to my efforts to identify the helicopter units operating at 11:00 p.m.
near New Vienna, Ohio, in the Clinton County vicinity on March 26, 1997.
O'Brein took my number and assured that a phone call would be returned
regarding my inquiries.</FONT></FONT></P>

<P><FONT COLOR="#FFFF00"><FONT SIZE=-1>APRIL 24th, 3:00 p.m. <BR>
A second phone call was placed again after the previous call had not been
returned. I asked for Lt. O'Brien, who came to phone and advised that he
would convey message to Major Jim Bolling, and I would receive a phone
call back.</FONT></FONT></P>

<P><FONT COLOR="#FFFF00"><FONT SIZE=-1>April 28th, 12:00 noon <BR>
A third phone call placed after no phone call was advanced. I asked for
Major Bolling, where the operator then said, "what is the nature of your
call." I stated the nature of the call, and was then told that Major Bolling
wasn't available, and for me to call back later. A later phone call to
Bolling again announced to him the nature of my inquiry, where he took
my phone number and assured me that he would call me back with the requested
information.</FONT></FONT></P>

<P><FONT COLOR="#FFFF00"><FONT SIZE=-1>May 2, 2:30 p.m. <BR>
After repeated phone calls over a period of a few days, several of which
were disconnected, others where answered where the party requested was
'unavailable,' contact was finally made with Major Bolling, where he stated
the helicopters in question were indeed ARMY NATIONAL GUARD HELICOPTERS,
and said there was nothing unusual about them being in the area, as they
conduct regular 'Night Vision Training' in the BUCKEYE MOA every Wednesday
night, and also specified a State Park where a route is flown around, which,
he said, was BRUSH CREEK STATE FOREST.</FONT></FONT></P>

<P><FONT COLOR="#FFFF00"><FONT SIZE=-1>The helicopter units, he said, were
not involved with the flare activity reported several hours previous. The
F-16 A.N.G. training, which originated from Springfield, Ohio, were the
Air to Air maneuvers that would account for chaffe and flares, but the
helicopter activity is strictly a coincidence where they had consecutive
missions in the area, but were not related at all. The confusion, he said,
was due to a <B>"COORDINATION SHORTFALL,"</B> as the two separate agencies
performed their routine operations on an independent basis.</FONT></FONT></P>

<P><FONT COLOR="#FFFF00"><FONT SIZE=-1>It is normal for the helicopters
to operate at the 11:00 p.m. time frame, and they usually commence around
9 or 10:00 p.m. Major Bolling added, "there was nothing unusual about the
helicopter presence, and they were all of ours. Any perception of certain
things "unusual" is strictly coincidental, according to Major Bolling.</FONT></FONT></P>

<P><FONT COLOR="#FFFF00"><FONT SIZE=-1>Note: The locality of the exercizes,
Brush Creek State Forest, is 39.5 miles south-east of the area specified
in the inquiry, which is Clinton County, Ohio.</FONT></FONT></P>
