Thousands of plant and soil samples gathered by BLT fieldteams have been examined by Michigan biophysicist W. C. Levengood, andin the last few years by multiple other scientists.&nbsp;&nbsp; The resultsstrongly indicate that a majority of the crop formations studied so farare NOT mechanically flattened, ruling out the "pranks with planks" idea.&nbsp;&nbsp;Regularly documented abnormalities in the plant and soil samples are, instead,�consistent with exposure to an intense and complex energy system whichemits heat (possibly microwaves) along with highly unusual electrical pulsesand strong magnetic fields.�&nbsp; While crop circles are the main emphasis,BLT has also been involved in the scientific examination of physical evidencefrom UFO and related events such as animal mutilations and abductions.</font></i></b><i><font size=+1></font></i><p><b><i><font size=+1>Talbott will present an overview of the scientificdata illustrating how plants and soils experience physical changes insideof crop formations.&nbsp; This will include the most recent XRD study whichrevealed unique crystallinity changes in crop circle soils (soon to bepublished).&nbsp;&nbsp; She will also present her investigations this summerinto multiple crop formations in Poland, including a spectacular eyewitnessaccount of a crop circle forming and multiple accounts of UFO observationsand interactions.&nbsp; Additionally, scientific results from analysesof physical evidence retrieved from the site of a witnessed UFO landingwill be presented.&nbsp; (Two Ohio analysts contributed data to this effort.)</font></i></b><i><font size=+1></font></i><p><b><i><font size=+1>Many may remember that Talbott actually saw a cropformation being made in Hoeven, Holland on Aug 21, 2001 (see the BLT web-site:&nbsp;www.bltresearch.com).&nbsp; Having been closely involved with the scientificeffort to understand these unusual phenomena for 12 years now, she is awealth of information and could keep our attention for much longer thanher scheduled time to speak.&nbsp; Talbott is an engaging speaker and youcan expect an eye-opening and intriguing afternoon.</font></i></b></body></html>
