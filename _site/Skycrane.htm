<BR>
and Captain Keytack follow-up</FONT></B> </P>

<P><FONT COLOR="#FFFF00"><FONT SIZE=-1>Contact was again made with CAPTAIN
KEYTACK this morning at 8:55 a.m. (330-609-1236). He said that he has completed
his FOIA reply and sent it to Senior Master Sergeant David Symmes for his
stamp of approval, his phone number is 330-609-1087. Symmes is the base
FOIA officer.</FONT></FONT></P>

<P><FONT COLOR="#FFFF00"><FONT SIZE=-1>He indicated the FOIA request was
what they call a 'Shotgun request' in which the request specified 'any
and everything' they had. He said the results of the FOIA will be quite
routine.</FONT></FONT></P>

<P><FONT COLOR="#FFFF00"><FONT SIZE=-1>Captain Keytack was asked about
the possibilities of the UFO seen on December 14, 1994 being a misidentified
helicopter.</FONT></FONT></P>

<P><FONT COLOR="#FFFF00"><FONT SIZE=-1>&quot;Not from this base,&quot;
he said.</FONT></FONT></P>

<P><FONT COLOR="#FFFF00"><FONT SIZE=-1>Keytack informed that no helicopters
are stationed at the airbase, which is an Air Force Reserve facility. Since
1953, the base has never had helicopters stationed here, although there
have been several 'visits' by helicopters periodically through the years.</FONT></FONT></P>

<P><FONT COLOR="#FFFF00"><FONT SIZE=-1>Keytack was asked about the helicopter
scenario since it has been postulated that two SKY CRANE helicopters were
seen flying in or near the Vienna/Youngstown Airbase several days prior
to the strange December 14, 1994 incident. This hypothesis was advanced
by an unknown officer with the Liberty Township police department, who
reportedly observed the helicopters and mused that the UFO sightings could
have been due to one of these helicopters.</FONT></FONT></P>

<P><FONT COLOR="#FFFF00"><FONT SIZE=-1>There are some very sober reasons
to doubt a helicopter involvement with the Trumbull County affair.</FONT></FONT></P>

<P><FONT COLOR="#FFFF00"><FONT SIZE=-1>&gt;From what is known, there is
nothing that would lead one to suspect that a helicopter would engender
the visual reports descriptively recounted by citizenry near the Sampson
Road vicinity, where the callers were reporting an 'object with flames.'
</FONT></FONT></P>

<P><FONT COLOR="#FFFF00"><FONT SIZE=-1>One caller commented: &quot;It looked
like the back end of a fighter-jet.&quot;</FONT></FONT></P>

<P><FONT COLOR="#FFFF00"><FONT SIZE=-1>Later, certain officers dispatched
to the scene, witnessing and even pursuing the object, reported 'no sound'
in conjunction with the sighting. The Pratt &amp; Whitney JFTD 12A-5A engines
used in a Sikorsky S-64 Sky Crane helicopter are not 'hush' equipped engines
nor designed for silent performance. </FONT></FONT></P>

<P><FONT COLOR="#FFFF00"><FONT SIZE=-1>Various descriptive statements are
on file, ranging from a 'red, rotating saucer' to a structured object with
a parachute-like appendage. One police officer reported the visual perception
of a 'red light' which was 'huge' and illuminated the ground, as if it
were daylight. Such a powerful 'red' light is not a routine headlighting
feature of a Sky-Crane or other helicopters.</FONT></FONT></P>

<P><FONT COLOR="#FFFF00"><FONT SIZE=-1>Even considering the possibilities
of witness misperception, the descriptive characteristics of a saucer-shaped
object, the &quot;rotating&quot; ballistic or flight performance, its silent
operation, flames and brilliant red light, when collectively gathered,
work strongly to eliminate a 'misidentified helicopter' scenario.</FONT></FONT></P>

<P><FONT COLOR="#FFFF00"><FONT SIZE=-1>Additionally, it would be unclear
what purpose a Sky Crane helicopter would have flying above a residential
neighborhood during the unusual midnight hour, and as reported, hovering
for an extended duration. Such night-time operations above a residential
neighborhood for these helicopters are generally not routine, further lessening
the chances of a 'misidentified helicopter' scenario.</FONT></FONT></P>

<P><FONT COLOR="#FFFF00"><FONT SIZE=-1>Captain Keytack, Public Relations
Officer of the Vienna/Younstown Air Base, said on July 22, 1998 that there
were no construction projects ongoing in December or 1994 that would warrant
a SKY CRANE helicopter at the airbase, and he also said, &quot;From a safety
point of view... no helicopters would fly in the evening.&quot;</FONT></FONT></P>

<P><FONT COLOR="#FFFF00"><FONT SIZE=-1>Furthermore, the FAA tower operator
who was contacted by the 9-1-1 dispatch officer during the UFO sighting,
advised that there was no radar track of any aircraft in the specified
vicinities, and additionally stated that the Youngstown FAA screens painted
no aircraft within a 60-mile radius of Youngstown. Sky Crane helicopters
are not routinely outfitted with Stealth radar-evading technology. If such
a helicopter were operational during this time frame, there is every indication
it would have surfaced on radar at some point, even if flying at an abnormally
low elevation (as most radar systems can even detect automobile and truck/semi
traffic on highways).</FONT></FONT></P>

<P><FONT COLOR="#FFFF00"><FONT SIZE=-1>Previous inquiries with Northside
Hospital concerning Life Flight emergency helicopters have also discounted
a similar helicopter explanation involving medical flights.</FONT></FONT></P>

<P><FONT COLOR="#FFFF00"><FONT SIZE=-1>To the left are some statistics
for one model of a Skycrane helicopter.</FONT></FONT></P>
