White Plains � Reports of �flying discs� or �saucers� over Westchester
were explained by the finding of a burst weather balloon with tinfoil radar
target attached in Greenburgh yesterday.
<p>The large paper kite fits descriptions of a �six-pointed star,� �a washtub�
and �an irregular silver object� glowing in reflected light as reported
from various parts of the country.
<p>The balloon and target kite are used by the U.S. Weather Bureau and
Army to measure wind velocity and direction.
<p>William T. Overton, eighteen of 154 North Road and James Mahoney, twenty-seven
of 43 Mitchell Place, White Plains, were cutting grass in the cbout 1:10
p.m. when they noticed a silver object floating earthward.
<p>Being a couple of skeptics and not particularly impressed with all this
talk of mysterious discs and saucers, �we didn�t pay attention to it,�
said Overton.
<p>About half an hour later the two men �just happened to run across� a
tin-foil covered kite-like object, measuring about three by four feet,
to which a burst balloon was attached with cord.
<p>Overton, who said he thought their find was a Weather Bureau balloon,
decided to take it to the Reporter Dispatch Office.
<p>A call in to the U.S. Weather Bureau in New York City verified the fact
that Overton and Mahoney had found a weather balloon.
