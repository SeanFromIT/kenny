<LI><FONT COLOR="#FFFF00"><FONT SIZE=-1>Report from WKRC CHANNEL 12 NEWS</FONT></FONT></LI>
</UL>

<P><FONT COLOR="#FFFF00"><FONT SIZE=-1>During telephone discussion with
reporter after 9:00 p.m. on March 27, WKRC Channel 12 News (Cincinnati)
confirmed to T.A.S.K. researcher Kenny Young that the news department had
received 'countless' reports of UFOs on Wednesday night. The news reporter
stated that the bulk of sightings came in between 8 and 9:00 P.M. The heaviest
concentration of reports were generated from the Clermont County communities
of Loveland and Georgetown, Ohio. The news department contacted the Georgetown
Ohio State Highway Patrol Post, where two officers also reportedly observed
the UFOs. Strangely, WKRC Channel 12 news did not convey the news of this
happening to the general public despite the massive amount of sightings,
because, according to the reporter, &quot;there was no explanation for
the event.&quot;</FONT></FONT></P>

<UL>
<LI><FONT COLOR="#FFFF00"><FONT SIZE=-1>Reports from Cincinnati Enquirer</FONT></FONT></LI>
</UL>

<P><FONT COLOR="#FFFF00"><FONT SIZE=-1>After a press release announcement
of this event was forwarded to various news agencies, a reporter at the
Cincinnati Enquirer news offices telephoned to add that their newsroom
had also received reports. They had even contacted Wright Patterson Air
Force Base to address the influx of calls they were receiving. The reporters
said that his editors wanted a more in-depth report on the recent activity,
and that he is writing an article which will appear in the SUNDAY edition
of Cincinnati Enquirer. Regrettably, however, the reporter said his editors
were 'micro-managing' the situation, and their 'story' was never published.</FONT></FONT></P>

<LI><FONT COLOR="#FFFF00"><FONT SIZE=-1>Report from MT. HEALTHY, HAMILTON
COUNTY</FONT></FONT></LI>
</UL>

<P><FONT COLOR="#FFFF00"><FONT SIZE=-1>8:00 p.m. A phone call from Jesse
XXXX (825-XXXX) was received by this writer regarding a UFO sighting near
Cheltenham Drive in Mount Healthy. Jesse said he witnessed a UFO with friend,
Josh. Both were outdoors looking for Comet Hale-Bopp, when they reportedly
observed a large white light 50 to 60 degrees above the horizon. The light
was surrounded by smaller lights that were 'scattered about.' The surrounding
lights flashed with a synchronized pattern. One small red light was occasionally
noticed to the side of the main object, best described as a 'white light.'
Jesse said he was 80 to 90% certain this was not an airplane. Dogs in the
neighborhood were barking 'radically.' Jesse fetched his camera and took
1-photo of the object, but isn't sure how it will come out because of darkness.
The object was visible for nearly 5 minutes before departure path to the
north.</FONT></FONT></P>

AND WARREN COUNTIES</FONT></FONT></LI>
</UL>

<P><FONT COLOR="#FFFF00"><FONT SIZE=-1>A telephone call was received by
a gentleman we will list as Dave on Thursday, March 27. He sounded sober
and coherent, and didn't want his name or place of employment listed. He
acquired my phone number by looking up &quot;UFO&quot; on internet.</FONT></FONT></P>

<P><FONT COLOR="#FFFF00"><FONT SIZE=-1>Dave works at a warehouse in Wilmington,
which is located within visual range of the two runway strips of the Wilmington
Airport. He was at work around 8:00 p.m. on Wednesday, March 26, 1997.
Workers began going outside and watching odd aerial lights which appeared
over the east part of Wilmington. The lights seemed to be positioned over
Hillsboro, which is in Highland County, and also over Cincinnati. The lights
were not Airborne or Federal Express traffic, which they see constantly
there, being located right off the runway.</FONT></FONT></P>

<P><FONT COLOR="#FFFF00"><FONT SIZE=-1>There were lights in a triangular
formation spotted by a second person and the security guard. The manager
of the company also saw them, and he was in the air force and had &quot;never
seen anything like them before.&quot; The primary witness (Dave) thought
it was a joke by 5-persons, and went outside to see a huge orange fireball,
which disappeared and reappeared. It would simultaneously fade as the other
would appear, almost in PERFECT conjunction with one another, assuming
the shape of a boomerang. It could not have been an airplane, he said.</FONT></FONT></P>

<P><FONT COLOR="#FFFF00"><FONT SIZE=-1>Dave had two questions: </FONT></FONT></P>

<UL>
<P><FONT COLOR="#FFFF00"><FONT SIZE=-1>1. Why over populated area? </FONT></FONT></P>

<P><FONT COLOR="#FFFF00"><FONT SIZE=-1>2. Why over Airborne Express and
Wilmington Airport?</FONT></FONT></P>
</UL>

<P><FONT COLOR="#FFFF00"><FONT SIZE=-1>At 7:35 p.m., Dave said that the
crowd also observed FOUR fighter jets appearing from the northwest. The
jets headed directly SOUTHEAST towards the lights, which had been under
observation prior to the arrival of the jets. The lights were in progress
at 7:30 and the jets flew overhead at 7:35 p.m. As the lights would "come
on" the jets would fly into that general vicinity as if playing a game
of 'cat and mouse.' The planes were in a semi-V formation, and flew so
low you could see the missiles underneath. The light show appeared 8 times
from 7:30 to 8:45 p.m. 11 witnesses. There was a 'main object' described
as a single orange ball. The other objects, described as 'red balls' would
light up and die in a straight line. Tracer lights could be seen from the
jets in general vicinity. The planes circled in one huge circle. The two
jets 'came back' at a higher altitude after engaging the lights. Sound
from jets were heard 'plain as day.'</FONT></FONT></P>

<P><FONT COLOR="#FFFF00"><FONT SIZE=-1>In the sky, the main object was
said to be larger than a dime at arms length. The main object didn't move
at all, and held stationary in one spot. The red balls appeared near the
main object. All the balls were brighter and larger than the stars, and
appeared randomly. When one would light up, the other would die, as if
it was 'borrowing' from the previous light. Unlike the ignitiion and extinguishing
characteristics of flares, stated the witness.</FONT></FONT></P>

<P><FONT COLOR="#FFFF00"><FONT SIZE=-1>The red ball formation appeared
in a boomerang and also a straight line pattern 5-times. There was no trail
to the little balls. The balls would appear and go across, a couple of
times went 'up' in the boomerang shape. They would arc, and the formation
would be comprised of 5-lights, sometimes forming a pyramid or triangle
shape.</FONT></FONT></P>

<P><FONT COLOR="#FFFF00"><FONT SIZE=-1>Dave felt that the air traffic to
Wilmington Airport may have been disrupted by this event, as no regular
flights in or out of the airport were underway during the happening. Automobile
traffic Southbound on State Route 73 was affected, however, as motorists
were hitting their brake-lights, according to the caller.</FONT></FONT></P>

<P><FONT COLOR="#FFFF00"><FONT SIZE=-1>Dave called the Sheriff's department
around 8:15 p.m. A security guard informed his daughter, and she also called
the police at 8:45 p.m. Both times, the dispatchers on duty said NO to
having HEARD of any unusual reports. Another employee contacted OHIO STATE
PATROL dispatch center in Wilmington.</FONT></FONT></P>

<LI><FONT COLOR="#FFFF00"><FONT SIZE=-1>Report from LOVELAND, OHIO</FONT></FONT></LI>
</UL>

<P><FONT COLOR="#FFFF00"><FONT SIZE=-1>Jake Ashcraft (583-XXXX) placed
a phone call at 9:15 p.m. to advise of sighting unusual light phenomenon
north of Loveland, Ohio, in Clermont County. The caller was with his girlfriend
when they sighted several lights which held stationary and then accelerated
at a rapid speed. There was a main object and also smaller objects in a
triangular formation. He felt certain they were not flares, nor were they
airplanes. He said there was no noise which could be heard. The caller
stated that there was a pinkish-white 'vapor trail' which could be seen
occasionally, and described the vapor trails as 'PIXELS on a computer screen
which faded out.' The main object was 'absolutely huge,' and the witness
said that many people 'had to have seen it.' He said the phenomenon was
easily visible from a laundrymat in Loveland, near a McDonalds restaurant,
and the twosome were looking to the north. The abnormality departed to
the north. </FONT></FONT></P>

<LI><FONT COLOR="#FFFF00"><FONT SIZE=-1>Other observations:</FONT></FONT></LI>
</UL>

<P><FONT COLOR="#FFFF00"><FONT SIZE=-1>T.A.S.K. Investigations Coordinator
Ron Schaffner received a telephone call from a resident of Brown County,
Ohio, who also observed the event from his locality, which is near the
town of Aberdeen. </FONT></FONT></P>

<P><FONT COLOR="#FFFF00"><FONT SIZE=-1>One witness who is an employee at
the warehouse in Wilmington placed a telephone call to his mother, who
lives near Rocky Fork Lake. His mother reportedly went outdoors and also
observed the phenomenon from her vantage point. </FONT></FONT></P>

<P><I><FONT COLOR="#FFFF00"><FONT SIZE=-1>All witnesses we spoke with expressed
their confusion at why this event had not been addressed through the local
news media, as they had listened closely for any explanatory reports (although
a Columbus, Ohio television station did report on the event).</FONT></FONT></I></P>

<UL>
<LI><FONT COLOR="#FFFF00"><FONT SIZE=-1>Report from E-mail</FONT></FONT></LI>
</UL>

<P><FONT COLOR="#FFFF00"><FONT SIZE=-1>The following E-mail message was
received at 1:00 a.m. on March 27, 1997. It was also forwarded to Ohio
UFO researcher Michael Sebring, who conveyed the information by E-mail.
The following message was returned to its originator with a reply asking
for more details. The response was delivered, and this is a compilation
of both preliminary message and response. The message is an excellent summary
of the perceived event, forwarded by a concerned citizen, and we appreciate
such quality submissions.</FONT></FONT></P>

<UL>
<P><TT><FONT COLOR="#00FFFF">&gt;&gt; Anyone hear any reports of UFO sightings
in the Dayton, OH area on Wednesday March 26, 1997? My fiance and I saw
some pretty spectacularly weird stuff in the sky over Caesar's Creek State
Park. There was nothing on the news about it despite the several people
we saw pulled off highway 73 to look at it. I've been looking at the sky
for a long time, but I've never seen anything even close to this. </FONT></TT></P>

<P><TT><FONT COLOR="#00FFFF">&gt;&gt; About a mile from the turn-off to
Caesar's creek beach we saw a big orange light in corner of the windshield.
It was several times brighter and larger than any object in the sky. It
divided into five pieces along a straight line and remained motionless.
Some other people saw it and were pulling off the road. The light furthest
to the left faded and disappeared. Three others did exactly the same thing
until only the original light was left, then it suddenly winked out. </FONT></TT></P>

<P><TT><FONT COLOR="#00FFFF">We then pulled into the beach's parking lot
and I was hurrying to set up my camera. I had the camera (a 35mm SLR on
a tripod) in place and was looking towards the area where we'd last seen
it with binoculars, when it appeared across the lake and began dividing
again. </FONT></TT></P>

<P><TT><FONT COLOR="#00FFFF">Through the binoculars it just looked like
a very bright oval orange light. I ran over to point the camera at it,
but by the time I'd lined up the shot it had winked out again, this time
only dividing twice. You really need video to shoot this kind of thing.
</FONT></TT></P>

<P><TT><FONT COLOR="#00FFFF">We stayed in the parking lot shooting the
comet for about a half hour and saw no more of the object. It is suppossed
to be clear again tonight. We will probably try to see if the object returns.
I know it wasn't a plane or a meteor or any other naturally occuring object.
We watched the 11:00pm news and the news this morning, but there was no
mention of it on any of the Dayton stations. I would really like to know
if anyone else was watching the sky, and what exactly they got to see.&lt;&lt;</FONT></TT></P>

<LI><FONT COLOR="#FFFF00"><FONT SIZE=-1>Report from CLINTON COUNTY SHERIFFs
DEPARTMENT</FONT></FONT></LI>
</UL>

<P><FONT COLOR="#FFFF00"><FONT SIZE=-1>A phone call to the Clinton County
Sheriffs department revealed that numerous calls had been received from
the general public in regards to the event. No reports had been filed,
although a police detective on patrol near New Vienna, Ohio, also witnessed
the happening, and attempted to pursue an 'object.' The sighting made by
the Clinton County Sheriff official was confirmed by two separate dispatchers
at the Clinton County Sheriff's Office. </FONT></FONT></P>

<P><FONT COLOR="#FFFF00"><FONT SIZE=-1>A dispatcher on-duty at 7:15 p.m.,
March 27 stated that the department had been advised that the lights were
explainable as 'helicopters.' When asked, the dispatcher couldn't advance
a source for this explanation, but added that it was advanced to their
satisfaction. T.A.S.K. suspects this faulty explanation was advanced simply
because the dispatcher didn't want to handle a &quot;UFO inquiry.&quot;</FONT></FONT></P>

<UL>
<P><FONT COLOR="#FF8000"><FONT SIZE=-1>Thanks very much for the interesting
reports. We have received several calls over the last 24 hours, which describe
events in the Midwest. Brief synopses appear below:</FONT></FONT></P>

<P><FONT COLOR="#FF8000"><FONT SIZE=-1>1) A mother and daughter in Dubuque,
IA, witnessed approximately 15 orange, distinctly round objects maneuvering
in the sky. The objects split into two groups, and then streaked off in
opposite directions. Time: About 1930-1945 hrs. (local), Wednesday, 26MR97.
</FONT></FONT></P>

<P><FONT COLOR="#FF8000"><FONT SIZE=-1>2) A man in Huron, OH, was standing
outside, looking at the comet. He witnessed two very bright, white, glowing
objects come streaking toward his position &quot;from Sandusky, Ohio.&quot;
He reported that each object was approximately &quot;3 times the size of
a star,&quot; and they were maneuvering relative to one another in &quot;wiggly
flight.&quot; Suddenly, the two objects executed what appeared to be right-angle
turn (viewed from the ground), and they streaked out of sight. Time: 2230
hrs. (local), Wednesday, 27MR97. Duration: 3 seconds.</FONT></FONT></P>

<P><FONT COLOR="#FF8000"><FONT SIZE=-1>3) A man in Wilmington, OH, witnessed
two bright lights positioned beside one another in the night sky. One of
the lights extinguished, then the second one disappeared, too, approximately
5 seconds later. Then, they suddenly reappeared, and extinguished again.
To his amazement, there was a streak of light, wider than the diameter
of a full moon, that flew over his head and disappeared over the horizon.
The man stopped his car to have a better look at the lights. When he stepped
out of his car to get a better look at the objects, he saw and heard a
flight of what appeared to be military fighter aircraft flying at a very
high speed in the direction of the objects last seen. Time: 1930 hrs. Wednesday,
26MR97.</FONT></FONT></P>

<LI><FONT COLOR="#FFFF00"><FONT SIZE=-1>BIZARRE REPORT FROM MAYSVILLE,
KENTUCKY</FONT></FONT></LI>
</UL>

<P><I><FONT COLOR="#FFFF00"><FONT SIZE=-1>Telephone call from JAMIE XXXX
(606) 564-XXXX Mason County, KY, placed 9:50 P.M. Sunday Night, March 30,
1997</FONT></FONT></I></P>

<P><I><FONT COLOR="#FFFF00"><FONT SIZE=-1>Time of event: Wednesday March
26. No planes in the area. Clear sky. The sun had just set, it was still
daylight outside. Time - 7:45 p.m., </FONT></FONT></I></P>

<P><FONT COLOR="#FFFF00"><FONT SIZE=-1>SUMMARY:</FONT></FONT></P>

<P><FONT COLOR="#FFFF00"><FONT SIZE=-1>While watching TV, witness spots
a BRIGHT FIERY LIGHT start dropping out of sky. This was observed from
the interior of his house, seen looking out his sliding doors. As the object
drops, the witness thinks it is an 'asteroid' or 'bomb.' The object has
definite motion from a high to a low elevation. The witness was expecting
the hillside to explode, and braced for some kind of impact. However, the
object doesn't hit the ground, but it reportedly stopped right above the
treetops, and at that moment the witness suddenly observes a second, identical
object above the first, which was either 'left behind' by the first object,
or else 'produced' the first object. The two objects were described as
3-dimensional spheres of light. An adjacent barn exists on nearby hill,
and the two objects were said to be 4-times the size of the barn from his
vantage point. Suddenly, 15 to 25 objects in perfectly straight line, extending
into infinity appeared 'in complete unison.' The further away, the smaller
the objects seemed, and the closer ones seemed larger. They looked like
the sun, really bright and round. This was called THE STRING.</FONT></FONT></P>

<P><FONT COLOR="#FFFF00"><FONT SIZE=-1>The string of lights stretched across
the entirety of the sky, and witness states emotional effect regarding
this observation, and claims: "Never seen anything like it before in all
my life. Incredible." The witness believes it could have been seen from
as far away as NEW YORK. Looking due north, 4,000 yards away from his house,
the witness observed the stationary string of white lights stretch from
horizon to horizon, but he felt the locality of the objects would have
been situated on Kentucky side of the Ohio River. The oddest happening
was when the initial light suddenly intensified in brightness, then the
next one does likewise, and so on, down the chain as far as could be seen.
From the bottom of the chain to the top, the lights intensified. After
they would intensify in brightness, they would continue to shine at that
level of luminousity. All lights in the endless chain were said to be perfectly
motionless, as no movement could be noted. The witness began screaming
for wife to come. Once he hollered, the string abruptly vanished, just
like you would "turn a light off." They did not vanish 'one at a time,'
but rather, all at one sudden moment, as the witness was directly asked
emphatically about this particular detail.</FONT></FONT></P>

<P><FONT COLOR="#FFFF00"><FONT SIZE=-1>The witness says he will be effected
for the rest of his life by this singular happening, and will compare the
light emanating from this as far more powerful than a nuclear explosion.
There were no shadows cast from the lights, even though they were "bright
like the sun."</FONT></FONT></P>

<P><FONT COLOR="#FFFF00"><FONT SIZE=-1>"It looked like God himself was
coming down out of heaven, walking on these steps of light, which stretched
across the sky in a straight line from horizon to horizon, and like a 'tweak'
was applied to each light that ran across the chain, which ran down it
and made it more solid... and brighter. Then they all just turned off."</FONT></FONT></P>

<P><FONT COLOR="#FFFF00"><FONT SIZE=-1>After a 10 or 15 second pause, a
600 foot. "spaceship" appeared, also witnessed by wife. The soundless 'spaceship'
was 'noticed' as no approach path was noted. When asked why the term 'spaceship,'
the witness commented: "I don't know what else to call it. It couldn't
have been anything from this earth." He added that there was no substance
to it. Without the lights on it, you wouldn't know it was there, even though
it was still partially daylight. The lights on the spaceship were not the
same as the one spotted when looking due north (the 'string'), as they
were not as bright. The only things that gave it definition was a bank
of 10 horizontal white lights and then a blue horizontal tint just above
and below the bank of white lights, and on the left side and the right
side was a little bit of reflection of the lights. The lights appeared
all at once, and in the same height and direction in the sky as the STRING.
The object just vanished, like someone turned of the lights. All of the
lights went out at exactly the same time, not one by one, and when asked
more specifically, the witness added that there was no indication of twinkling
or burn-out, as visible with common flares. Sometimes the lights looked
stationary, sometimes like they were revolving around it. At this point,
the witness ran indoors to get his camera.</FONT></FONT></P>

<P><FONT COLOR="#FFFF00"><FONT SIZE=-1>The 'spaceship' appeared twice,
but the second time it was getting darker outside. As it appeared the second
time, visible for a shorter duration, the witness did not have his camcorder
prepared, and was loading the tape into it. Neighbors were said to have
witnessed the spaceship as it appeared the second time. The distance between
the observer and the 'spaceship' was estimated to be about 4,000 yards
away, and its size was said to be as big as a barge. It was in clear view,
with no obstructions blocking the angle of observation. The witness characterized
as follows: "Horizontal bank of white lights, sometimes motionless, sometimes
revolving around the spaceship. I'm sure it was nothing from this world,
there's just no way. I was able to see this thing crystal clear, not anything
far off or uncertain. Its elevation seemed to be 200 feet from the ground,
around 100 feet from treetops. Again, I say it's hard to describe, but
there was no solid structure or substance. Without lights turned on, you'd
never know it was there."</FONT></FONT></P>

<P><FONT COLOR="#FFFF00"><FONT SIZE=-1>Finally having his videocamera ready,
the witness recorded 15 MINUTES of VIDEO, which did not capture the image
of the spaceship or the string. The spaceship had vanished, after appearing
twice. Now, all that remained was small white lights that moved randomly,
and they appeared and then disappeared. They seemed to be far off in the
distance, 10 to 20 miles away.</FONT></FONT></P>

<P><FONT COLOR="#FFFF00"><FONT SIZE=-1>Around 2 of the 15 minutes of the
video contain images of white lights that vanish and reappear. The individual
lights, as visible, were present for 15 to 20 seconds at a time.</FONT></FONT></P>

<P><FONT COLOR="#FFFF00"><FONT SIZE=-1>The neighbors had already been contacted,
and the witness called another 'buddy' from MAYSVILLE, eight miles away.
On May 17, 1996, this Maysville resident had witnessed unusual lights as
well. He knows the night well because a family member was burned in a fire
on that night. He thinks this person also observed STRING or the SPACESHIP,
because he heard him set the phone down and run outside when he placed
the call.</FONT></FONT></P>

<P><FONT COLOR="#FFFF00"><FONT SIZE=-1>The witness called WRIGHT PATTERSON
AIR FORCE BASE an hour later.</FONT></FONT></P>

<P><FONT COLOR="#FFFF00"><FONT SIZE=-1>NOTE: This account is currently
under investigation, and the videotape will be subjected to computer analysis</FONT></FONT></P>

<LI><FONT COLOR="#FFFF00"><FONT SIZE=-1>Report from JERRY BLACK</FONT></FONT></LI>
</UL>

<P><FONT COLOR="#FFFF00"><FONT SIZE=-1>30- year UFO investigator Jerry
Black (625-2613) received a telephone call on Wednesday, March 26, from
an anonymous contact at the Wilmington Airport. The contact advised Black
that &quot;Two F-16 jets would be conducting training maneuvers in the
Clermont County vicinity for the next several hours. The jets originated
from the Springfield, Ohio Air Base.&quot; This information was acqired
by the contact at the Wilmington airport, who reportedly observed the two
fighter jets, and called a friend at the Springfield, Ohio airbase to verify
their operations in the area. This was strictly an UNOFFICIAL advisement,
both to the contact at the Wilmington airport and the relay to Jerry Black.
</FONT></FONT></P>

<P><FONT COLOR="#FFFF00"><FONT SIZE=-1>The following morning, Black placed
a phone call to the WILMINGTON AIRPORT CONTROL TOWER. Black learned that
there was NO DISRUPTION in air traffic on March 26, as witnesses had claimed.
According to the supervisor at the Wilmington Tower, no FEDERAL EXPRESS
or AIRBORNE EXPRESS flights begin until 11:00 P.M. A check of the log book
revealed NO ENTRIES concerning F-16s or FLARES reported at the WILMINGTON
TOWER. Black conducted the telephone interview with the air tower supervisor
at 1:30 p.m., March 27. The supervisor added that the tower is unmanned
until 10:00, FLIGHTS COMMENCE AROUND 11:00 p.m. </FONT></FONT></P>
