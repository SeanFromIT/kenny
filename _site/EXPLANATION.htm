<P><B><FONT COLOR="#FFFF00">AN EXPLANATION IS ADVANCED!</FONT></B> </P>

<P><FONT COLOR="#FFFF00"><FONT SIZE=-1>Key information on the March 27th
case was furnished when contact was made with a Sergeant at the SPRINGFIELD
AIR NATIONAL GUARD BASE, in Springfield, Ohio.</FONT></FONT></P>

<P><FONT COLOR="#FFFF00"><FONT SIZE=-1>Here is an assessment of the conversation:</FONT></FONT></P>

Fighter Squadron Flying Unit Fighter Operations division </FONT></FONT></I></LI>

<LI><I><FONT COLOR="#FFFF00"><FONT SIZE=-1>Subject: Sergeant involved with
Air operations.</FONT></FONT></I></LI>
</UL>

<P><FONT COLOR="#FFFF00"><FONT SIZE=-1>The Sergeant, contacted by telephone
at 4:15 p.m. on Thursday, March 27, 1997, stated that there were eight
F-16s involved in air-to-air dogfight maneuvers the previous evening. The
Sergeant had already been asked about UFO reports, as someone from Columbus
had also called, after spotting a news report on this from a Columbus TV
station.</FONT></FONT></P>

<P><FONT COLOR="#FFFF00"><FONT SIZE=-1>It is a common practice to utilize
flares as a defensive maneuver. When asked the practicality of this practice
over residential neighborhood, the Sergeant held that it was not a big
concern, since the flares don't hit the ground. Because of the rare clarity
of the night, that's why so many people noticed the activity. The Sergeant
stated that the maneuvers have been conducted there for at least 10 to
12 years, and this is the first time in his 26 years of experience that
this was thought to be UFOs.</FONT></FONT></P>

<P><FONT COLOR="#FFFF00"><FONT SIZE=-1>All of these operations are always
conducted on Wednesday nights. The purposes for the maneuvers are "Night
Intercepts" against other F-16s, are these routinely conducted engagements
are mock dogfights between multiple planes from an elevation of 5,000 to
50,000 feet</FONT></FONT></P>

<P><FONT COLOR="#FFFF00"><FONT SIZE=-1>The purpose for flares is to draw
the sensor systems on the other airplanes and/or missiles to the heat of
the flare, which has a brighter glow and heat signature than the plane
engines. A heat-seeking missile locks on to this heat source and is lured
away from its target by the diversionary flare. The flare is dispenced
and the jet fighter is then plunged into an evasive roll or maneuver. This
is a common practice which trains the pilot on how to incorporate a common
defensive maneuver. &quot;DROP AND ROLL.&quot; The combination of flare(s)
and jet-engine vapor confuses untrained ground observers into thinking
of ODD HAPPENINGS in the skies above.</FONT></FONT></P>

<P><FONT COLOR="#FFFF00"><FONT SIZE=-1>The activity on March 26 was taking
place over the restricted air corridor known as the BUCKEYE MOA (Military
Operating Area) which covers a large area of Southern Ohio, and stretches
from Wilmington to the lower corner of Adams County, and includes the cities
of Bainbridge, Hillsboro and Peebles. The exercizes are conducted anywhere
from 5,000 to 50,000 feet. At a higher altitude, the maneuvers wouldn't
even be seen, according to the A.N.G. Sergeant.</FONT></FONT></P>

<P><FONT COLOR="#FFFF00"><FONT SIZE=-1>Once every 3 months or so these
exercises will be flying every Wednesday AND Thursday nights. At around
twilight before dark, they practice bombing runs on the dam at Rocky Fork
lake.</FONT></FONT></P>

<P><FONT COLOR="#FFFF00"><FONT SIZE=-1>Next week (1st of April, 1997) they
will be flying Wednesday and Thursday nights.</FONT></FONT></P>

<P><FONT COLOR="#FFFF00"><FONT SIZE=-1>Springfield ANG schedules every
aircraft that flies in area, F-16s from TOLEDO, FT. WAYNE and TERRE HAUTE
(4 units) KC-135s from Columbus and Rickenbacker. The Sergeant said that
this corridor does not test fly experimental aircraft.</FONT></FONT></P>

<P><FONT COLOR="#FFFF00"><FONT SIZE=-1>This practice is routinely conducted
in other parts of the country, and will also account for the reports in
Arizona, which are of similar description to the March 26, 1997, March
12, 1997 and October 16, 1996 events from Ohio, which have been addressed
in detail in previous investigations, and explained to the satisfaction
of this writer. </FONT></FONT></P>
