coordinator forwarded a report detailinga suspected UFO sighting from the small community of Gratis, located inSouthern Ohio. His e-mail message, dated Oct. 22, 1998, states:</font></font><ul><tt><font face="ARIAL,HELVETICA"><font color="#FFFFFF">I saw somethinginteresting tonight on the way home from work. My wife and I were on Camden/WestElkton Road, just north of Wayne Trace, when we noticed a bright lightin the sky, flying low headed eastward. We recognized the light as theheadlight of a bright aircraft, yet it pulsated instead of blinking onand off. As the craft got closer we notice two blinking lights on bothsides of the center light. We parked our vehicle in the middle of the roadand just observed the craft as it came closer. I was out of the car listeningfor the recognizable sound of a helicopter. I knew it couldn't be a plane,as it didn't travel like a plane does.&nbsp;</font></font></tt><p><tt><font face="ARIAL,HELVETICA"><font color="#FFFFFF">As it came fairlyclose into view I noticed that it didn't make any noise like a plane, jetor helicopter. This craft "Hummed." I also noticed a bright rear lightas it passed. I asked my wife how she would describe this bright lightin the rear of the craft and we came to an agreement that it was yellowish/amberin color and it illuminated the rear section of the craft. What was strangeabout this rear light was how it was illuminated in appearance. At firstI thought I was looking at a jet engine flame, but there was no sound tosupport this, so it had to be a light that created this cone shape glow.If this was a rear illuminating light, I could not tell you what the shapeof the tail section was.&nbsp;</font></font></tt><p><tt><font face="ARIAL,HELVETICA"><font color="#FFFFFF">I know this soundsconfusing, but at first I thought it was a helicopter, with no sound butonly a hum. After watching it "HUM" off into the distance, I believe itpossibly could have been a chopper that uses some for of Silent Mode ability.&nbsp;</font></font></tt></ul><font face="ARIAL,HELVETICA"><font color="#FFFFFF">Samuel first reported'strange lights' previously seen by his wife and daughter near Gratis,Ohio in an e-mail message dated November 17, 1997. A separate, unrelatedindividual also reported a UFO near Gratis, Ohio on February 5, 1998. Thedetails of these sightings are located at: <b><a href="https://kenny.anomalyresponse.com/GRATIS.htm">https://kenny.anomalyresponse.com/GRATIS.htm</a></b></font></font><p><b><font face="ARIAL,HELVETICA"><font color="#FFFFFF">Investigation:</font></font></b><br><font face="ARIAL,HELVETICA"><font color="#FFFFFF">The Preble CountySheriff's Department was contacted (937-456-6262) at 6:20 a.m. on Friday,Oct. 23. A female dispatcher who handled the call would not assist in theinvestigation, and when asked to check the logs reference any other reportssimilar to above, the dispatcher remarked: "I don't check logs."</font></font><p><b><font face="ARIAL,HELVETICA"><font color="#FFFFFF">Additional Comment:</font></font></b><br><font face="ARIAL,HELVETICA"><font color="#FFFFFF">Gratis is 41.5 milessouthwest of Fairborn, Ohio, home of Wright- Patterson Air Force Base.&nbsp;</font></font><p><font face="ARIAL,HELVETICA"><font color="#FFFFFF">This same area isalso the locality of a very mysterious incident happening on September8, 1998, in which an alleged helicopter was reported down in Preble County.A truck driver reportedly overheard a plea for help from a crashed helicopterpilot who requested that Wright-Patterson Air Force Base be alerted, afarmer in the area reported hearing aircraft engine sounds, and DaytonInternational Airport officials detected an E.L.T. (Emergency Locator Transmission)distress signal all within the same time-frame. A search and rescue operationconducted by The Butler County Sheriff's Office announced that no traceof a crashed helicopter had been found.

The date of this was Thursday, October 22,1998. What time of the evening was it when you sighted this?&nbsp;</font><ul><font color="#00FFFF">The time was between 9:00 - 9:30 P.M..</font></ul><font color="#FF8000">2. Did your wife also notice the object and thinkit strange?</font><ul><font color="#00FFFF">Yes she saw it and thought it was strange thatthe Head Light "pulsated" instead of blinking. She also found it strangethat it " Hummed" and didn't make a recognizable sound.</font></ul><font color="#FF8000">3. What did your wife think it was?&nbsp;</font><ul><font color="#00FFFF">She didn't know what to think it was. She statesthat it was just "Weird". She also said it could had been one of thosestealth helicopters because of the "hum"</font></ul><font color="#FF8000">4. You say it is possible that this could have beena chopper in a Stealth mode, but what leads you to this conclusion?</font><ul><ul><ul><li><font color="#00FFFF">the low altitude that it was flying in</font></li><li><font color="#00FFFF">I was able to hear it clearly and it was not thesound of a prop or jet plane&nbsp;</font></li><li><font color="#00FFFF">When you watch a plane or jet fly you notice thecharacteristics of how it moves through the air. When you see a helicopteryou notice that it performs differently.&nbsp;</font></li><li><font color="#00FFFF">I can tell the difference between a plane, jet orCare Flight Chopper at night. I have had close contact with Medical chopperstaking off, landing and flying at night. It behaved like a helicopter,it just didn't have the standard sound of one</font></li><li><font color="#00FFFF">The only helicopter that I have ever seen that utilizesa "Silent Mode" of running is a military craft. I'm sure there are commercialchoppers that have this option but have you seen any around here ? I haven't.&nbsp;</font></li></ul></ul></ul><font color="#FF8000">5. A follow-up to the previous question: If, in youropinion, this is a chopper in Stealth mode, why do you think it would haveLIGHTS for everyone to see?</font><ul><font color="#00FFFF">You tell me. I have no idea why it would makeitself so obvious. I would like to have been able to say that it was searchingfor something, but I can't.&nbsp;</font></ul><font color="#FF8000">6. What was the height and elevation?</font><ul><font color="#00FFFF">A) I'm not the best when it comes to judgingheight, but it was flying low like a small aircraft would fly around here.It was not flying high like a commercial aircraft does.</font></ul><font color="#FF8000">7. How did you first come to notice this?</font><ul><font color="#00FFFF">We were headed west on Camden West Elkton Roadwhen I pointed out this bright light in the sky which was close. I toldmy wife that this would be a tremendously bright star, but it was too lowand it was moving. It was headed right towards our general direction, soI decided to stop the car and observe it. The pulsating front light mademe curious.</font></ul><font color="#FF8000">8. Was the road busy, and were other cars/housesin the area?</font><ul><font color="#00FFFF">A) There was no other cars in the area, thisis a country road. The houses are farm houses, which means they are generallyfar apart. We had just passed a farm house on the right and then we stoppedthe car, to observe the aircraft. Plus there is no lights around exceptthose located on the barn of the farms in this area.</font></ul><font color="#FF8000">9. What was the direction of travel? (N to S, etc.)</font><ul><font color="#00FFFF">A) The aircraft was traveling SW to E.</font></ul><font color="#FF8000">10. How close was it to you?</font><ul><font color="#00FFFF">A) It was approx.. 1000 feet away. If you knewthe area, it flew between Camden West Elkton Rd. and Northern Rd. Theseto roads run basically parallel to one another.&nbsp;</font></ul><font color="#FF8000">11. How did it depart from view?</font><ul><font color="#00FFFF">A) It flew past us, on the south side of us,continued traveling east in the direction of West Elkton. After watchingit hum away, my wife insisted that I leave because I was parked on thestreet watching it. My thoughts were... "This was cool, because this wasflying in 'Silent, Stealth Mode' but with its Lights on..."
