When she answered the phone I explainedthe reason I was calling.&nbsp; When I asked if she had been witness toan unidentified flying object and screams of a woman, she replied in asomewhat alarming tone saying "Oh yes! I saw it! So did my daughter!"</font></b><p><b><font face="Arial,Helvetica">Mrs. Woods explained that there is afield behind her house and five properties are adjacent to this field.Behind her home there is a small knoll and on the other side of the knollis where the field is, and up the hill from there is the house of the firstwitness to UFO. Mrs. Woods informed that there are some trees in the fieldbetween her and the Davis house.</font></b><p><b><font face="Arial,Helvetica">The importance for the property descriptionis because the alleged UFO "came down" in this particular field.</font></b><p><b><font face="Arial,Helvetica">Around 5:30 P.M. on the day in questionMrs. Woods and her daughter Sally (name changed, on file) were decoratingthe outside of their home, putting up Christmas lights. Mrs. Woods saysshe looked up and saw this "white light."</font></b><p><b><font face="Arial,Helvetica">It was jumping and bouncing all overthe sky. It began to descend behind the trees. At one point Mrs. Woodssaid that it reminded her of popcorn "popping up and down" from behindthe trees.</font></b><p><b><font face="Arial,Helvetica">Mrs. Woods told her daughter to go insidethe house and stay, that she would finish up with the Christmas light.She said she did because her daughter was apparently alarmed (Both motherand daughter had a UFO sighting about this same time last year.)</font></b><p><b><font face="Arial,Helvetica">Mrs. Woods says that she bent over forjust a second taking her eyes off the light and when she looked back upthe light was gone. She does not know if it flew away or landed behindthe trees.</font></b><p><b><font face="Arial,Helvetica">Mrs. Woods then says that suddenly allthe animals in the neighborhood went into a frenzy. Every dog was barkingand howling and sounding like they were in a panic.&nbsp; She said thather own little Chihuahua hid under the bed and cried in a pitiful toneof voice.&nbsp; Mrs. Woods told me that she was afraid that he had becomeill but now he was feeling better.</font></b><p><b><font face="Arial,Helvetica">At no time did Mrs. Woods or her daughterhear a screaming woman.</font></b><p><b><font face="Arial,Helvetica">Upon entering the house Mrs. Woods saidthat both her phone and her daughters cell phone began to ring.&nbsp; Onher daughter's phone was her girlfriend asking Sally if she was OK.&nbsp;On Mrs. Wood's phone was her first cousin asking the same question.&nbsp;Both mother and daughter were perplexed and asked both parties on the phoneswhat was going on.</font></b><p><b><font face="Arial,Helvetica">Both parties said there was activityon the police scanner, that someone had reported a woman screaming on SkaggsRd. and the police were on their way.&nbsp; Both mother and daughter assuredthe cousin and girlfriend that they were OK.</font></b><p><b><font face="Arial,Helvetica">About that same time she saw flashinglights thru the window and went to the door to see the Fire and Rescuesquad. Without getting out of the vehicle, the officer rolled his windowdown and Mrs. Woods yelled thru the open door that they were OK and thatnobody had been screaming at their house. (NOTE: She did not report theUFO sighting)</font></b><p><b><font face="Arial,Helvetica">While Sally took another call from aconcerned friend, Mrs. Woods says she watched thru the window as more policearrived.&nbsp; Both Life and police squads drove slowly down the streetshining their search lights into yards and between houses.&nbsp; Mrs. Woodsstates that a state trooper also showed up and went down the street.</font></b><p><b><font face="Arial,Helvetica">After combing the whole area with searchlightsthe police and Rescue squad departed.</font></b><p><b><font face="Arial,Helvetica">I thanked the witness for her time andif I have more questions I would call.&nbsp; She took my number and saidshe was going to see if she can get some people to look in that field tosee if anything interesting could be found.&nbsp; I told her to call meASAP if anything is turned up</font></b><br>&nbsp;<p><b><font face="Arial,Helvetica">COMMENTS:</font></b><p><b><font face="Arial,Helvetica">1.&nbsp; After talking to Mrs. WoodsI called the Kentucky State patrol. I gave the dates of both Nov. 23rdand Nov. 21st to the dispatcher.&nbsp; She could find no record of a reportof UFO sightings or anyone being called out about a woman screaming onSkaggs Road.</font></b><p><b><font face="Arial,Helvetica">2.&nbsp; There is a wide discrepancybetween the time Mrs. Woods and Mr. Davis saw the UFO and heard the panickedanimals. Mrs. Woods states between 5:30 P.M. and 6 P.M. the first UFO witnessalleged the sighting before 10:00 P.M. This is a mystery since I believethey described seeing the same object and equally heard the commotion fromthe animals. I asked Mrs. Woods several times if she was very sure of thetime.&nbsp; She stated that she was sure of the time because she wantedto wait till dusk so she could try out the Christmas lights to see howthey looked.</font></b><p><b><font face="Arial,Helvetica">3. Because of the time difference Ibecame suspicious that something else may be going on here. I asked Mrs.Woods if anything unusual had gone on after the UFO sighting.&nbsp; Shesaid that she has a clock that chimes out of sync with the time. When itwas 8 o'clock the clock would chime 7 times.&nbsp; Her husband noticedit around Thanksgiving when he got home from a business trip, and she becameaware of the problem at that time.&nbsp; He was not home when the UFO incidentoccurred.&nbsp; He said it would have to go to a clock shop to be repairedbecause he did not know how to fix the problem.&nbsp; Also Mrs. Woods toldme that the next morning after the UFO sighting she awoke to a terriblenose bleed.&nbsp; She said they have been frequent since the sighting andhas never had nose bleeds before.&nbsp; She attributes the nose bleedsto the house being too dry.&nbsp; She says her daughter has had nose bleedsfor years off and on but she has never had one. After hearing these comments,I became suspicious that she was familiar with UFO material. I must stressthat she was not prompted on these questions and offered them out of theblue. I then asked her if she read UFO material before and she said: "Ohno, I don't read anything, I've only watched X-Files a few times on TV."</font></b><p><b><font face="Arial,Helvetica">4. While I was talking to Mrs. Woodson the phone her daughter (13-years old) came in from school.&nbsp; Herdaughter states that she had been talking to a friend on the bus. Thisfriend is the son of the first UFO witness. He had told Sally that thescreaming sounds seemed to be a woman that was "being torn apart."&nbsp;The scream was so blood curling and horrible, he told her on the bus.</font></b><p><b><font face="Arial,Helvetica">5. Mrs. Woods said that her house hadbeen broken into not long ago. She called the police and despite the departmentbeing less than 2-minutes from her home, it took law officers 20-minutesto arrive. The intruder-who was walking around the house-remained in thehome while she awaited the arrival of the police, but the police did notcatch the intruder.</font></b><p><b><font face="Arial,Helvetica">6. During the UFO sighting, the 13-yearold daughter looked frightened and said in a groan: "Oh no, not again,I'm beginning to think we are not safe around here anymore." Since theUFO sighting, Mrs. Woods says that her daughter does not want to stay inher room and leaves the door open when going in the bedroom (she used tolock the door) and now sleeps in the same room with her mother.</font></b><p><b><font face="Arial,Helvetica">7. I am most perplexed by the time difference.Her UFO sighting was nearly 4-hours before the first witness reported thesame object with same animal reaction (immediately followed by calls ofconcern regarding the screams). I will not venture a guess in this regards,but let others interpret data.</font></b><p><b><font face="Arial,Helvetica">8. Mrs. Woods is formerly in the military,a paratrooper who also held a security clearance. She is now disabled froma back injury caused while jumping out of an airplane. She is intelligentand articulate. I think she is a credible witness.</font></b><p><b><font face="Arial,Helvetica">Filed 12/02/03</font></b><br><b><font face="Arial,Helvetica">Donnie Blessing</font></b><br><b><font face="Arial,Helvetica">Southern Ohio Section Director MUFON</font></b><p><hr WIDTH="100%"><center><b><font size=+2>UPDATED REPORT BY<br>DONNIE BLESSING</font></b></center><p><br><br><p><b><font face="Arial,Helvetica">At 8:10 P.M. tonight, December 3rd,2003 I spoke to a Mrs. Huff (name withheld on file).&nbsp; I asked herif I could speak with her daughter, Nancy (name withheld on file).&nbsp;I had obtained her number from Nancy's friend, Chris Woods (name also withheldon file). I asked Nancy if she could tell me more about what was said onthe police scanner the night of the screaming woman incident. Mrs. Huffsaid that Nancy was at a basketball game and I then asked if she knew anythingabout the incident.</font></b><p><b><font face="Arial,Helvetica">Mrs. Huff said that her husband wasa volunteer with the Fire and Rescue squad and that he told her a callhad came into the station from someone saying that they saw 'a woman witha baby' that was walking around on a hill, and that 'a spaceship' camedown and took the baby and the woman began to scream.&nbsp;</font></b><p><b><font face="Arial,Helvetica">Mrs. Huff then asked her husband ifit was a crazy woman who might have needed mental help and he said thathe did not know who it was.</font></b><p><b><font face="Arial,Helvetica">At this point I was shocked. I askedMrs. Huff to repeat what she said. There was a loudly crying child on herlap that made it hard to hear. She said that story is what was being passedaround at the station.&nbsp;</font></b><p><b><font face="Arial,Helvetica">I stumbled over my words while tryingto calmly asl if I could speak to her husband.&nbsp; Mrs. Huff said thathe was not home&nbsp; (he would not be home until about 9:30 P.M.).&nbsp;I asked if she thought he would talk to me about this and she said yes,that he would talk to me.&nbsp; She also said that her husband would knowthe time the call came in.&nbsp; I told her that I appreciated her talkingto me and that I would call back at 9:30.</font></b><p><b><font face="Arial,Helvetica">At 9:35 P.M. on December 3rd, 2003 Ispoke to a Mr. C. Huff (name withheld on file). Mr. Huff is a volunteerfor the Fire and Rescue squad in Morehead, Ky.</font></b><p><b><font face="Arial,Helvetica">Mr. Huff explained that he had beenlying on the bed listening to the scanner and had not been on duty thatday. He thought that the time was somewhere between 4-6 A.M.&nbsp;</font></b><p><b><font face="Arial,Helvetica">He went on to say that it was a manwho called and said that there was a woman in a field screaming.&nbsp;He did not know who the person was that called. I asked Mr. Huff if hewas totally certain that the time was between 4-6 A.M. and he said thathe would check and for me to call him tomorrow.</font></b><p><b><font face="Arial,Helvetica">Mr. Huff went on say that he had heardthat one person in the team searching for the screaming woman was approachedby a man while they were in the vicinity of the Kentucky State Patrol outpostand Skaggs Rd. This man walked over to one of the officers and stated thathe had seen the whole thing.&nbsp; He told the officer that he saw "a womanin a field and that a spaceship had came down and had taken the woman."</font></b><p><b><font face="Arial,Helvetica">I asked Mr. Huff if he could tell mewho this officer was and he stated he did not know.&nbsp; He did not knowif it was a police officer or a member of the rescue team.</font></b><p><b><font face="Arial,Helvetica">This was second hand information tohim.&nbsp; I asked if he could find out for me and he stated that he wouldnot be allowed to give the persons name or the officer's name.</font></b><p><b><font face="Arial,Helvetica">Mr. Huff went on to recount anotherincident that occurred one or two days after the report of the screamingwoman.&nbsp; He says that a woman had called the station to complain thata child about two years old had been seen walking down route 60 in Moorhead"wearing only a diaper."</font></b><p><b><font face="Arial,Helvetica">The woman had been returning home fromher niece's house, she had turned off Route 32 onto Rt. 60 headed westto Salt Lick when she spotted the child.&nbsp; She immediately called thepolice.&nbsp; When they arrived the child was gone. No missing child wasever reported according to Mr. Huff. Mr. Huff did not state if the womanhad left the scene where the child was to call the police. Further investigationinto this, I feel, is warranted.</font></b><p><b><font face="Arial,Helvetica">I then asked Mr. Huff if there was anythingelse he could offer on the incident of the screaming woman and he saidno.&nbsp; I thanked Mr. Huff for his time and told him I would call backto see if he had found the correct time of the call.</font></b><p><b><font face="Arial,Helvetica">COMMENTS</font></b><p><b><font face="Arial,Helvetica">Mr. And Mrs. Huff had different stories.There seemed to be some confusion as to where the baby fit into the story.&nbsp;I left all comments intact as reported to me since we do not have the fulltrue account yet.&nbsp;</font></b><p><b><font face="Arial,Helvetica">This case has escalated in intensity,being made that much more stranger by the alleged eyewitness sighting ofa woman being 'taken' by a UFO.</font></b><p><b><font face="Arial,Helvetica">Filed 12/03/03</font></b><br><b><font face="Arial,Helvetica">Donnie Blessing</font></b><br><b><font face="Arial,Helvetica">Southern Ohio Section Director MUFON</font></b><center><hr WIDTH="100%"><br><b><font face="Arial,Helvetica">UFO RESEARCH</font></b><br><b><font face="Arial,Helvetica"><a href="https://home.fuse.net/ufo">Returnto MAIN PAGE</a> |&nbsp; <a href="mailto:anomalyresponse@gmail.com">E-mail Questionsor Comments</a></font></b></center></td></tr></table></center><br>&nbsp;<br>&nbsp;</body></html>
