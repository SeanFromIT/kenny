I can't beginto tell you how many E-mails I receive, from people that frequently don'tlist their names, just wanting to ask basic questions or wanting someoneto communicate with. Sometimes there is abuse involved, sometime peoplehave stupid questions or remarks, others with mindless claims. All of itis a waste of my time to sort through and worse, feel obligated to respondto... as I have for quite some time.</font></b><b><font face="Arial,Helvetica"></font></b><p><b><font face="Arial,Helvetica">As of 2004 I will no longer make myselfavailable to questions or comments from the general public, simply becauseit has not been productive for me to do so. Looking further, I don't seevery many other serious research or investigative forums where questionsor comments are welcome. No skeptical agenda or 'debunker' site, that Iam aware of, offers direct contact info for a particular researcher, Ihave tried numerous times to contact certain 'celebrity debunkers' andthey do not offer themselves for questions or comments. I used to thinkthis meant that particular individual stood in some sort of ideological'ivory tower' or was afraid of questions, but now I think I am beginningto see why there is a need for this policy.</font></b><b><font face="Arial,Helvetica"></font></b><p><b><font face="Arial,Helvetica">Perhaps it is the UFO subject, in general,which is bristling with sorted nuts and loons. Having received countlesstragic messages from uneducated buffoons and ideological idiots for someperiod of time has given me a bad attitude toward the subject. It is a'learning' thing. I quickly acknowledge that the UFO field is, currently,not a scientific nor legitimate, in the conventional sense, study of interest.Academia has abandoned the study of UFOs long ago, for varied reasons,and the snake-oil salesmen and 'loony tunes' have stepped in to fill thatvacancy and keep the subject alive.</font></b><b><font face="Arial,Helvetica"></font></b><p><b><font face="Arial,Helvetica">I have tried to track and monitor theUFO situation, and report on factual and verifiable claims and other reportswith an objective and skeptical approach. I have tried to offer a seriousreporting forum for breaking news and information, focused mainly in theGreater Cincinnati area. The increasing barrage of E-mail is appreciated,as it reflects a large and growing readership. I value your interest. Butif there were a serious need to avail oneself to the abuse, repeated questions,stupidity and tomfoolery of the general public then I would re-think mycurrent attitude.</font></b><b><font face="Arial,Helvetica"></font></b><p><b><font face="Arial,Helvetica">Please know that I am always open toserious inquiries, questions and criticisms. But I will accept no furtherquestions or comments from anonymous 'E-mail.' This means I may not respondto every E-mail inquiry. If you are a 'serious researcher' then you shouldbe on UFO UpDates or Current Encounters, where there is serious discussionabout these issues, and not presenting yourself in an anonymous forum orunder some 'pseudo-identity.'</font></b><b><font face="Arial,Helvetica"></font></b><p><b><font face="Arial,Helvetica">Thank you for understanding my frustration.Current and local news tips are always welcome and the Cincinnati UFO Hotlineat 513-588-4548</font></b><b><font face="Arial,Helvetica"></font></b><p><b><font face="Arial,Helvetica">Kenny Young</font></b><br><b><font face="Arial,Helvetica">UFO Research</font></b><br><b><font face="Arial,Helvetica">https://home.fuse.net/ufo</font></b><br><b><font face="Arial,Helvetica"></font></b>&nbsp;</blockquote><center><p><br><hr WIDTH="100%"><br><b><font face="Arial,Helvetica">UFO RESEARCH</font></b><br><b><font face="Arial,Helvetica"><a href="https://home.fuse.net/ufo">Returnto MAIN PAGE</a> |&nbsp; <a href="mailto:anomalyresponse@gmail.com">E-mail Questionsor Comments</a></font></b></center></td></tr></table></center><br>&nbsp;<br>&nbsp;</body></html>
