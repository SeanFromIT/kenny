<P><FONT COLOR="#FFFF00"><FONT SIZE=+2>UFO/9-1-1 Police Tapes Acquired
from The 1994 Trumbull County Disturbance</FONT></FONT> </P>

<P><FONT COLOR="#FFFF00"><FONT SIZE=-1>Through the assistance of two telecommunicators
with the Trumbull County 9-1-1 dispatch center, 911 Howland Rd. NE, Warren,
Ohio, information was made available concerning a stunning UFO incident
happening in December of 1994.</FONT></FONT></P>

<P><FONT COLOR="#FFFF00"><FONT SIZE=-1>The information relevant to this
case, which I had previously requested from former Operations Manager Rober
J. Caffro, who is no longer employed at the center, has been researched
by two telecommunicators with the Trumbull County 9-1-1 dispatch center
after acquiring the date of the incident from an unnamed officer with the
Liberty Township Police department. Their research efforts were conducted
strictly as private citizens.</FONT></FONT></P>

<P><FONT COLOR="#FFFF00"><FONT SIZE=-1>I spoke with one officer at the
9-1-1 center who contacted me to advise that the specific date of the occurrence
was now known. The date of this unbelievable UFO pursuit by numerous police
agencies in northeastern Ohio was on December 14, 1994.</FONT></FONT></P>

<P><FONT COLOR="#FFFF00"><FONT SIZE=-1>For a nearly three week period I
corresponded with two telecommunicators at the 9-1-1 center relevant to
this incredible case, and the audio tape copies are now in my possession
as of Monday, June 1, 1998.</FONT></FONT></P>

<P><FONT COLOR="#FFFF00"><FONT SIZE=-1>A sober, scientific analysis of
this case is now pending.</FONT></FONT></P>

<P><FONT COLOR="#FFFF00"><FONT SIZE=-1>The officers stressed that they
requested the information about the UFO disturbance as a public citizen,
and not acting on behalf of the 9-1-1 Center in any official capacity.</FONT></FONT></P>

<P><FONT COLOR="#FFFF00"><FONT SIZE=-1>He began an investigation into this
event after reading my report on the internet. I initially acquired the
first public details of this incident by accident during a phone call to
the wrong telephone number in early 1996.</FONT></FONT></P>

<P><FONT COLOR="#FFFF00"><FONT SIZE=-1>The telecommunicator who assisted
in retrieving this information personally spoke with several officers regarding
the date of the event. The original report appearing on the internet was
created without a specific date of the event, and subsequently contains
a number of errors due to this lack of specific data. In due time, this
report will be revised to reflect these new findings.</FONT></FONT></P>

<P><FONT COLOR="#FFFF00"><FONT SIZE=-1>The telecommunicator who conducted
the investigation was not fully aware of the UFO incident and was not 'on-duty'
the night of the occurrence, but had heard of the sighting through others
at the 9-1-1 center. Being highly intruiged by what had happened, he was
left totally baffled after review of the dispatch tapes, saying: &quot;This
all seems so unreal.&quot;</FONT></FONT></P>

<P><FONT COLOR="#FFFF00"><FONT SIZE=-1>&quot;One of the officers who was
working that night had remembered the date because several people who work
at the police department pull gags on each other by taking local newspapers
and cutting them up and rearranging them to make funny headlines,&quot;
he said.</FONT></FONT></P>

<P><FONT COLOR="#FFFF00"><FONT SIZE=-1>One of these friendly 'gags' referenced
the UFO seen by an officer, so it was from the date of that newspaper that
a date of the incident was acquired.</FONT></FONT></P>

<P><FONT COLOR="#FFFF00"><FONT SIZE=-1>The telecommunicator, acting unofficially,
has made the effort to transfer all of the calls and radio traffic regarding
the UFO incident onto an audio tape. He said that several 'Saturday afternoons'
have been spent retrieving the information. Some of the police dispatches
and radio traffic are unrelated to the UFO disturbance, and the irrelevant
dispatches are being left out.</FONT></FONT></P>

<P><FONT COLOR="#FFFF00"><FONT SIZE=-1>&quot;This is real interesting looking
into what happened that night,&quot; said the officer. &quot;It's UNREAL.&quot;</FONT></FONT></P>

<P><FONT COLOR="#FFFF00"><FONT SIZE=-1>The UFO was seen by officers from
many different departments for several hours, according to the officer.
The log tapes reflect massive radio and telephone correspondence between
midnight and 6:00 a.m.</FONT></FONT></P>

<P><FONT COLOR="#FFFF00"><FONT SIZE=-1>&quot;We suspect that whatever was
there was seen both north and south in the county,&quot; the officer stated,
&quot;in two separate areas at the same time.&quot;</FONT></FONT></P>

<P><FONT COLOR="#FFFF00"><FONT SIZE=-1>In review of the tape, the telecommunicator
learned that there were many calls made by the 9-1-1 dispatch office to
the Youngstown FAA control tower. The audio tapes will reflect that at
the same time 9-1-1 dispatch officer Ms. Rudolph was viewing the UFO from
her vantage point at the 9-1-1 center, FAA tower operators 4-miles away
denied viewing the same object, even with binoculars.</FONT></FONT></P>

<P><FONT COLOR="#FFFF00"><FONT SIZE=-1>Earlier, this reporter confirmed
that all FAA tower operators were fired after the incident. This finding
was made during a phone call to the Youngstown FAA tower in June of 1996,
later referenced in my report on the incident titled: &quot;The Trumbull
County Disturbance.&quot;</FONT></FONT></P>

<P><FONT COLOR="#FFFF00"><FONT SIZE=-1>At present, an FOIA request has
been sent to the FAA control tower requesting complete details on this
event. The receipt of this FOIA request to tower officials has been confirmed.</FONT></FONT></P>

<P><FONT COLOR="#FFFF00"><FONT SIZE=-1>I have independently interviewed
Officer Toby Melero, who stated that the electrical instrumentation of
his patrol cruiser was 'shut down' by the disc-shaped, rotating light that
hovered over a residential neighborhood. I have spoken with others, including
Dispatcher Rudolph, who have conveyed to me their knowledge of this strange
and mystifying account. To this point, all my inquiries reached a dead-end,
being without the one key element most needful to confirm the account:
a date.</FONT></FONT></P>

<P><FONT COLOR="#FFFF00"><FONT SIZE=-1>It may now be possible to conduct
further scrutiny of this happening on the basis of the newly discovered
'date of event.' The present acquisition of audio tapes relevant to the
UFO situation in the Trumbull County, Ohio area, will enable us to conduct
a detailed analysis of this incident, utilizing sober scientific methods
and critical scrutiny with the hope of advancing a solid, credible explanation
to this otherwise terribly interesting mystery.</FONT></FONT></P>

<P><FONT COLOR="#FFFF00"><FONT SIZE=-1>An attempt will be made to convert
this incredible event onto a RAM file that internet patrons may access
through REAL AUDIO. This effort may take some time and through coordination
with others who have such means. This file will be accessed through this
web-site upon its completion.</FONT></FONT></P>
