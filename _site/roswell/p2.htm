  <p><font size=-1 face="arial, arial narrow, helvetica">LR: What
he's eluding to is a lot of continuous disinformation out there. There
are some liars out there now. But if you take the original people who were
interviewed then, I don't think any of them are lying.</font> </p>
<p><font size=-1 face="arial, arial narrow, helvetica">CC: Do you
think it's extraterrestrial?</font>
<p><font size=-1 face="arial, arial narrow, helvetica">CR: Something
definitely crashed. There's no doubt about that. There is a little bit
for everybody in this story.</font>
<p><font size=-1 face="arial, arial narrow, helvetica">KY: After
seeing the 'big picture,' what was it that brought you the idea for a book?</font>
<p><font size=-1 face="arial, arial narrow, helvetica">CR: We had
a lot of strange things happen to us, things that were somewhat unexplainable.
Those strange things seemed to be leading us.</font>
<p><font size=-1 face="arial, arial narrow, helvetica">LR: I guess
we could tell them a few things, Curt. We could tell them what we saw riding
up the road that one day when you stopped the jeep, couldn't we?</font>
<p><font size=-1 face="arial, arial narrow, helvetica">CR: We saw
some evidence, but we're not going to tell you what it was.</font>
<p><font size=-1 face="arial, arial narrow, helvetica">LR: We were
driving up the side of a mountain. Understand that this part of New Mexico
is totally flat except for about two spots, one of them is a mountain range
around Albuquerque. In the southern part of the state there is one bump,
and you can see that for miles, it is Capitan Mountain, the Ragsdale crash
site. After talking with Shiela that morning, we were impressed that we
had finally seen the crash site.</font>
<p><font size=-1 face="arial, arial narrow, helvetica">CR: We thought
we were in a position where we could now zero in, but we wanted to give
the Ragsdale site one last look.</font>
<p><font size=-1 face="arial, arial narrow, helvetica">LR: We wanted
to take some measurements -- prove to ourselves that Ragsdale must have
seen something else, the crash couldn't have happened there.</font>
<p><font size=-1 face="arial, arial narrow, helvetica">CR: We had
gone through a whole series of mathematical computations. We were trying
to explain this from a scientific standpoint, trying to determine how an
event could occur at the Ragsdale site and so forth. Right now, we're beginning
to think that there may not be much merit to the Ragsdale site - at least
from the standpoint of the UFO crash.</font>
<p><font size=-1 face="arial, arial narrow, helvetica">LR: The reason
we had discredited the site was because everything we had read about it
was negative.</font>
<p><font size=-1 face="arial, arial narrow, helvetica">CR: So there
we were, 53 miles from nowhere. I mean NOWHERE, and we're driving along
on this road and get to Capitan Mountain and here's this great big motor
home in front of us heading the same direction. A coyote ran across the
road trying to get away from the motor home, and at that point, we thought
about writing a book.</font>
<p><font size=-1 face="arial, arial narrow, helvetica">LR: So we're
way out there in this 4-wheel drive jeep going up the side of this mountain
on a two-track dirt road hoping we don't meet someone coming along in the
opposite direction. Then, all of a sudden, Curt slams on the brakes. It's
straight down one way and straight up the other way, nothing but scrubby
brush everywhere you look. So he throws the door open, gets out and starts
up through the brush. I'm sitting there in the passenger's seat wondering
what did I miss?</font>
<p><font size=-1 face="arial, arial narrow, helvetica">CR: It was
colder than hell, too.</font>
<p><font size=-1 face="arial, arial narrow, helvetica">LR: And I'm
sitting in the passenger seat wondering what I missed. Curt doesn't want
me to tell you what he saw...</font>
<p><font size=-1 face="arial, arial narrow, helvetica">CR: But we
found something.</font>
<p><font size=-1 face="arial, arial narrow, helvetica">LR: He starts
hollering at me, so finally I get out and start looking for him. I finally
found him, and it really was pretty amazing. It's a kind of a coincidental
thing, but we were looking at each other and saying <i>this is really bizarre.</i></font>
<p><font size=-1 face="arial, arial narrow, helvetica">CC: Did you
actually see something?</font>
<p><font size=-1 face="arial, arial narrow, helvetica">LR: We brought
it back.</font>
<p><font size=-1 face="arial, arial narrow, helvetica">CC: But how
did you know to find it there?</font>
<p><font size=-1 face="arial, arial narrow, helvetica">CR: I was
just driving along, stopped and I looked. Jumped out of the vehicle, left
the door open. It's just one of those mysterious things.</font>
<p><font size=-1 face="arial, arial narrow, helvetica">LR: Something
just caught his eye.</font>
<p><font size=-1 face="arial, arial narrow, helvetica">CR: Honest
to goodness. I just felt like I had to get out of the vehicle and there
it was. It was about 50-feet from the road.</font>
<p><font size=-1 face="arial, arial narrow, helvetica">LR: When you
think about the scrubby pinion pines and brush and all that kind of stuff.
To be honest with you, if I were standing there and somebody had said that
there was something really bizarre within 20 feet of me, I would have never
seen it. You would just have to look at it in the right way, and (LR slaps
his forehead) it all comes to you.</font>
<p><font size=-1 face="arial, arial narrow, helvetica">CR: It was
a sign, that's what it was. It was a sign, so we continued on up the mountain.</font>
<p><font size=-1 face="arial, arial narrow, helvetica">LR: Remember
now, we were there to discredit this place.</font>
<p><font size=-1 face="arial, arial narrow, helvetica">KY: What time
of the day was this?</font>
<p><font size=-1 face="arial, arial narrow, helvetica">CR: It was
more towards the evening.</font>
<p><font size=-1 face="arial, arial narrow, helvetica">LR: I'd say
when that happened it was more towards 2 O'clock in the afternoon.</font>
<p><font size=-1 face="arial, arial narrow, helvetica">KY: So you
retrieved a physical artifact?</font>
<p><font size=-1 face="arial, arial narrow, helvetica">CR: Something.</font>
<p><font size=-1 face="arial, arial narrow, helvetica">KY: Was this
something man-made?</font>
<p><font size=-1 face="arial, arial narrow, helvetica">CR: Yes.</font>
<p><font size=-1 face="arial, arial narrow, helvetica">KY: If I poked
at you for details, would you be responsive?</font>
<p><font size=-1 face="arial, arial narrow, helvetica">CR: We wouldn't
tell you. Not right now.</font><p><font size=-1 face="arial, arial narrow, helvetica">LR: It's material
to this whole thing. It definitely fits. I will tell you what some of the
other artifacts that we brought back were.</font>
  <img border="0" src="duo.jpg" width="317" height="241" align="left"><p><font size=-1 face="arial, arial narrow, helvetica">CC: Did you
know when you saw this artifact, though, that it would have some impact
on what we have been fed and told all along?</font>
<p><font size=-1 face="arial, arial narrow, helvetica">LR: Yes, it
definitely fits. There's so much that happened this one day that by the
end of the day I was sitting in a restaurant shaking.</font>
<p><font size=-1 face="arial, arial narrow, helvetica">CR: He was
shaking. He was absolutely shaken. He was so scared, but I wanted to go
back, because while we up there, we found something REALLY bizarre. We're
not going to tell you what that was. We found something MUCH more bizarre,
and I wanted to go back that night, but Larry said: There's no way you're
going to get me to go back there.</font>
<p><font size=-1 face="arial, arial narrow, helvetica">LR: This all
happened in one day, the deal with the red Jeep, the Corn interview and
the trip to the Ragsdale site. I would think it's a bit humorous at this
point.</font>
<p><font size=-1 face="arial, arial narrow, helvetica">CC: What exact
day did you make this historical discovery?</font>
<p><font size=-1 face="arial, arial narrow, helvetica">LR: It would
be in mid-October of '96. I don't recall the exact date but we'll get it
for you.</font>
<p><font size=-1 face="arial, arial narrow, helvetica">CR: Actually
it would be more towards the end. It would have been possibly the 24th
or 25th of October.</font>
<p><font size=-1 face="arial, arial narrow, helvetica">LR: So the
weirdness went on. We go on up to the rock, and you have to understand
that the way you recognize the Ragsdale site is by this unique rock there
with a crack through it. We spent about an hour at this one site picking
up stuff and throwing it in the back of our jeep. We then go on up the
side of a mountain and try to remember where this rock is. The first time,
we had a countour map that showed us where this rock was and it still took
us an hour to find it. You have to be looking right at it to see it.</font>
<p><font size=-1 face="arial, arial narrow, helvetica">CR: We're
talking about the side of a mountain with this countour map and we kept
going in and out trying to find it for over an hour, so it was remarkable
that we found the rock. Most people don't find it.</font>
<p><font size=-1 face="arial, arial narrow, helvetica">KY: Did you
photograph this location while on the site with the artifacts that you
discovered?</font>
<p><font size=-1 face="arial, arial narrow, helvetica">LR: Yeah,
but we're not going to show you. We have pictures of all the artifacts,
this will be included in the book.</font>
<p><font size=-1 face="arial, arial narrow, helvetica">CR: We're
not going to tell you the whole story today.</font>
<p><font size=-1 face="arial, arial narrow, helvetica">LR: So we
go on back up to the site, and we're still fumbling around although we've
already been there once looking for it. We finally find it and we use the
rock as our centerpoint. I had a notepad with me and Curt had a notebook
with him. We sit on the rock and discuss what we're going to do there --
about taking some measurements, compass bearings, or whatever. Suddenly,
we hear this noise. There is a rustling sound coming from the brush. At
first, we thought it must have been a BIG animal.</font>
<p><font size=-1 face="arial, arial narrow, helvetica">CR: You can't
see real well in there, because of the brushy growth.</font>
<p><font size=-1 face="arial, arial narrow, helvetica">LR: Then out
of nowhere here comes this guy -- hiking real fast...</font>
<p><font size=-1 face="arial, arial narrow, helvetica">CR: Almost
jogging...</font>
<p><font size=-1 face="arial, arial narrow, helvetica">LR: ...and
approaches right up to us, holding a Jim Ragsdale book like the one we
had purchased on our first visit to the museum. He says:<i>"Aha, so zis
must be ze place! I zee vee zeek ze zame zing!"</i></font>
<p><font size=-1 face="arial, arial narrow, helvetica">CR: Can you
believe this? Now this guy has this book open, a Jim Ragsdale book, and
he's running. He comes running up through the trees and we're standing
there looking at him.</font>
<p><font size=-1 face="arial, arial narrow, helvetica">LR: Remember,
we told you that this place is hard to find, so this guy, we assume, must
have been looking for it for quite a while. He comes up to it, takes a
peek at it, and (LR snaps his finger) out of there he goes.</font>
<p><font size=-1 face="arial, arial narrow, helvetica">CC: That quick?</font>
<p><font size=-1 face="arial, arial narrow, helvetica">CR: Yeah.</font>
<p><font size=-1 face="arial, arial narrow, helvetica">CC: Did he
come from Germany?</font>
<p><font size=-1 face="arial, arial narrow, helvetica">LR: Yes, he
was German.</font>
<p><font size=-1 face="arial, arial narrow, helvetica">KY: Did he
see what you saw?</font>
<p><font size=-1 face="arial, arial narrow, helvetica">LR: He has
the book in his hand. He sees the crack in the rock.</font>
<p><font size=-1 face="arial, arial narrow, helvetica">KY: Did he
see what you saw?</font>
<p><font size=-1 face="arial, arial narrow, helvetica">LR: He has
the book in his hand. He sees the crack in the rock.</font>
<p><font size=-1 face="arial, arial narrow, helvetica">CR: Here this
guy drives a minumum of 50-miles from Roswell on this 4-wheel-drive road
and suddenly leaves after 5-minutes. He disappears. He didn't even stay.</font>
<p><font size=-1 face="arial, arial narrow, helvetica">LR: Here's
another part of the story. So we went on and spent a couple of hours up
there, and at the end of our day, we find him still parked down there in
a white Buick. Why would he come all the way out there, 53-miles, walk
through all this brush to find this rock, look at it for a few seconds,
and then go back and sit in his car for two hours?</font>
<p><font size=-1 face="arial, arial narrow, helvetica">CR: It's very
weird.</font>
<p><font size=-1 face="arial, arial narrow, helvetica">LR: So at
that point in time, we worked away from the rock. Based upon what we've
read concerning Ragsdale, we were thinking that most likely this is not
the real site. But, we wanted to prove it for ourselves. Curt is thinking
that if anything really did happen at this site in 1947, knowing how hard
it would be to get it all cleaned up, any evidence would not be found way
up at the site - it was just too high up. The event occurred 50-years ago.
Whatever was left behind would be washed down the side of the mountain
by now. So, we decided that our best chance of finding stuff would be to
start working our way down the mountain, examining the stream beds and
kicking rocks over to see what, if anything, might be wedged between or
under the rocks. So we work our way down a little bit. We use our hands
to check under these things. It looks like a moonscape up there -- many
huge boulders. We get our hands down into the loose soil and leaves and
pine needles to see if there was anything down in there. Suddenly there
is something. <i>What is that?</i></font>
<p><font size=-1 face="arial, arial narrow, helvetica">We come out
with a crumpled up mess of... well, something or another, and we're knocking
the leaves and sediment off of it. There is some small printing on it --
and what do you suppose it is? It was a very old decayed C-ration wrapper.
There were several of them, actually.</font>
<p><font size=-1 face="arial, arial narrow, helvetica">KY: What do
you believe is the significance of finding C-ration wrappers at this location?</font>
<p><font size=-1 face="arial, arial narrow, helvetica">CR: It told
us that somebody had used military C-rations there. We thought it quite
interesting that we found it there. We found some of them at locations
up near the rock, too.</font>
<p><font size=-1 face="arial, arial narrow, helvetica">LR: So, picture
this. I'm standing there scratching my head over this find. I head back
to the rock to get my note pad and start taking some notes.</font>
<p><font size=-1 face="arial, arial narrow, helvetica">CR: Now, understand
that this is the Ragsdale crash site, the site that the larger UFO Museum
claims to be the site of the crash. When Larry and I were there, we were
finding evidence of C-rations and other things at this site. We were asking
each other why we are finding this stuff here?</font>
<p><font size=-1 face="arial, arial narrow, helvetica">LR: Why hadn't
the museum people been out here to look around? To us, it looked as if
we were two of only a very few people who had found the place.</font>
<p><font size=-1 face="arial, arial narrow, helvetica">CR: They didn't
bother to go out and look.</font>
<p><font size=-1 face="arial, arial narrow, helvetica">LR: If they
were so proud of this site, you'd think they would've had all this stuff
hanging on their wall. This stuff points directly to some possibility of
a military encampment or operation here many years ago.</font></ul>
