<p><font face="arial, arial narrow, helvetica"><font size=-1><b>Kenny Young:</b>
Tell us a little about Larry Rogers and Curt Robinson. What are your educational
and occupational backgrounds, and have either of you had any previous writing
or research experience?</font></font>
<p><font face="arial, arial narrow, helvetica"><font size=-1><b>Larry Rogers:</b>
I am from Terre Haute, Indiana, born in 1950. I graduated from college
in '72 with a degree in electrical engineering. I went straight into Uncle
Sam's Army after graduation from college, and it was in Uncle Sam's Army
where I had my first little encounter that got me interested in the UFO
topic. I have no experience in writing books, prior to this. I do have
a lot of experience at writing, in terms of technical writing and training
materials, and speaking before groups of people... but this has been my
first attempt at something like this.</font></font>
<p><font face="arial, arial narrow, helvetica"><font size=-1><b>Curt Robinson:</b>
Well I'm from Michigan, born in 1946 and attended Michigan State University,
engineering. I went into business in 1971for the first time with a consulting
firm. Later went into construction and after that, management consultant.
I've been in Cincinnati for 15 years, married for 30 years with 4 children.
Larry and I enjoy doing exciting things. That's why we became involved
in something this exciting. We do a lot of reading, and we're both real
interested in mysteries...</font></font>
<p><font face="arial, arial narrow, helvetica"><font size=-1>LR: That's
just the engineer in us. We like to figure out how things work. A mystery
is the same thing. We want to figure out how it works.</font></font>
<p><font face="arial, arial narrow, helvetica"><font size=-1>CR: We don't
always believe everything we read. That could be either an advantage or
disadvantage.</font></font>
<p><font face="arial, arial narrow, helvetica"><font size=-1><b>Chris Coffey:</b>
How did you guys hook up?</font></font>
<p><font face="arial, arial narrow, helvetica"><font size=-1>LR: Going
back about five years ago, I lived in South Carolina, working freelance
in project management at various plants as a contractor. I received a call
from a guy I had worked with on a few projects, he wanted me to come to
Cincinnati and work on a project that was going to last a couple of years.
I made the big decision to leave the sunny south to come to Cincinnati
and work on that project. Upon arrival here, I discovered an 'old coot'
that would be sharing an office with me...</font></font>
<p><font face="arial, arial narrow, helvetica"><font size=-1>CR: An old
coot or a young coot?</font></font>
<p><font face="arial, arial narrow, helvetica"><font size=-1>LR: An old
coot. We worked a couple of years together. That's how we met. We would
frequently chat and discover areas of mutual interest...</font></font>
<p><font face="arial, arial narrow, helvetica"><font size=-1>CR: We became
working partners, so to speak. Then, after we completed that project, we
continued to get together once or twice a week for brunch at Bob Evans
Restaurant. We were regulars there -- they had a table with our name on
it. Many fascinating subjects would arise. One day, the subject of UFOs
came up.</font></font>
<p><font face="arial, arial narrow, helvetica"><font size=-1>LR: As is
recall, my interest was sparked by a comment from my brother, who had told
me about the Alien Autopsy movie that had aired recently on television.
I rented a copy and, to be honest, I found it really strange. So at our
next brunch I think I mentioned to Curt something like 'Wow, I saw the
strangest thing on TV last night, and this thing supposedly happened in
1947... where the hell have I been all these years that I didn't know about
this?'</font></font>
<p><font face="arial, arial narrow, helvetica"><font size=-1>Curt was already
familiar with the topic, and he told me that he had a collection of books
on the topic, including a signed copy of a book by Kevin Randle. He said
that he would lend it to me so I could get all caught up on the Roswell
UFO topic. That's as far as our discussion went at that point.</font></font>
<p><font face="arial, arial narrow, helvetica"><font size=-1>KY: So you
had no previous interest in Roswell?</font></font>
<p><font face="arial, arial narrow, helvetica"><font size=-1>LR: I had
never heard of it before.</font></font>
<p><font face="arial, arial narrow, helvetica"><font size=-1>CR: I had
a prior interest, yes, from the standpoint of having read that book. I
found it an interesting subject. Anything that's scientific in nature and
theory I have an interest in. You should see my library. It seemed like
that the book had a lot of factual data, so that's why I bought the book.
At brunch, we began talking about Roswell -- what happened there -- what
we thought might have happened there.</font></font>
<p><font face="arial, arial narrow, helvetica"><font size=-1>Anyhow, I
was planning a family vacation to Costa Rica. I asked Larry to come along,
and we were actually thinking about the timing and so forth. But, at each
of our meetings, the subject of Roswell began to dominate the discussion.
We each started reading anything we could find on the topic. It finally
got to the point one day where Larry just said Let's just go to Roswell
and see what it's like. Just to say we've been there, walk on the soil...</font></font>
<p><font face="arial, arial narrow, helvetica"><font size=-1>LR: Breath
the air they breathed... that sort of thing.</font></font>
<p><font face="arial, arial narrow, helvetica"><font size=-1>CR: We scrapped
the Costa Rica vacation idea and went to Roswell. The kids were disappointed,
but on we went. That's how it started.</font></font>
<p align="center"><b>Broken boulder that marks</b> <b>the Ragsdale Crash Site</b> taken in 1996<br>
<img border="0" src="ragsrock.jpg" width="411" height="270"><p><font face="arial, arial narrow, helvetica"><font size=-1>KY: So once
out there you stumbled onto something.</font></font>
<p><font face="arial, arial narrow, helvetica"><font size=-1>LR: Not on
the first trip. On the first trip, we came away from there wondering 'what
the heck is all this about?' because it wasn't what we had expected. You've
seen the stuff on TV shows and read the books about the crash site and
how you can tour crash sites, right? Well, we go out there and drive into
downtown Roswell and there is the UFO museum, just as we expected. So we
walk in, and the first thing we want to know is 'where's this crash site
and how do we get there?'</font></font>
<p><font face="arial, arial narrow, helvetica"><font size=-1>They ask 'which
crash site are you talking about?' So, picture this. I'm looking at Curt
and he's looking at me, as if asking how many crash sites are there, anyway?</font></font>
<p><font face="arial, arial narrow, helvetica"><font size=-1>CR: We just
wanted to see it.</font></font>
<p><font face="arial, arial narrow, helvetica"><font size=-1>LR: We found
everything like that out there, dueling museums and dueling crash sites.</font></font>
<p><font face="arial, arial narrow, helvetica"><font size=-1>CR: You go
to buy a hamburger and find 'Alien Burgers' for sale.</font></font>
<p><font face="arial, arial narrow, helvetica"><font size=-1>LR: So we
came back and thought something was wrong with this picture.</font></font>
<p><font face="arial, arial narrow, helvetica"><font size=-1>KY: Now what
year was this?</font></font>
<p><font face="arial, arial narrow, helvetica"><font size=-1>CR: 1996.
And at that time, we had no idea of writing a book -- never thought of
it. We just wanted to walk the soil where this all happened. We weren't
writers, obviously, but we were curious -- how could there be more than
one crash site? All of a sudden, it was like the Randle and Schmidt book
no longer was the Bible, because now we had the Jim Ragsdale story and
other theories. In fact, we came back from Roswell confused, asking what's
wrong with this whole picture?</font></font>
<p><font face="arial, arial narrow, helvetica"><font size=-1>LR: We were
humored by things like the dueling museums each having their own crash
site. We thought we would get up to the Ragsdale crash site and there would
be a popcorn stand up there and the FBI would be selling hot-dogs. It was
hard to take much of this seriously on that first trip. We were both disappointed
and confused. The books are so believable and seemingly factual, and yet
you can get out there and find that everyone has got their own spin.</font></font>
<p><font face="arial, arial narrow, helvetica"><font size=-1>CC: Do you
think that from the beginning you could have been somehow 'driven' to find
the truth?</font></font>
<p><font face="arial, arial narrow, helvetica"><font size=-1>LR: For me,
it was a case of coming back from all the disillusionment and going back
to the books, asking 'how does this guy come to this conclusion while this
other guy over here is going down this track? They're on different tracks
but using the same names and same witnesses, and coming up with different
stories. And the interesting thing about it is they trash each other...</font></font>
<p><font face="arial, arial narrow, helvetica"><font size=-1>CC: So it's
more of a mystery you wanted to solve?</font></font>
<p><font face="arial, arial narrow, helvetica"><font size=-1>LR: Initially,
yes. It was a real mess out there. We went back to the books, and we started
to see new things the second time around. We decided to set up a spreadsheet
and put each of these in a computer database. We wanted to see if there
was some pattern to the way one writer would draw one conclusion, while
another writer uses the same witnesses and goes off in a totally different
direction.</font></font>
<p><font face="arial, arial narrow, helvetica"><font size=-1>CR: What actually
possessed us to go there in the first place is an interesting question.</font></font>
<p><font face="arial, arial narrow, helvetica"><font size=-1>LR: The first
trip was in June or July of 1996. In about October of 1996 we had decided
to go back, because we had wanted to see the crash site where the owner
would take you out on the land. We found it too coincidental that the one
museum sends its customers to a crash site located in a national forest
where there is no issue with a land owner -- that was a little too commercial
for us. We wanted to see both sides of the story. So on that second trip
we called the owners of the crash site referenced in the Randle and Schmidt
books -- Hub and Shiela Corn. The site is located about seven miles off
of Route 285, north of Roswell.</font></font>
<p><font face="arial, arial narrow, helvetica"><font size=-1>CR: And in
the meantime we had already started quite a bit of research, some out of
curiosity, trying to follow-up and figure out what was wrong with this
whole picture.</font></font>
<p><font face="arial, arial narrow, helvetica"><font size=-1>LR: Actually
we began that trip at the University of New Mexico map center. We thought
it would be cool to get some contour maps of various areas that we wanted
to look at so we could take notes on where we had been and what we had
seen. Asking for directions on campus, we were directed to the Engineering
building where the map center is located on a downstairs level. We went
down the escalator... and then a real surprise hit us. The name of the
map center...</font></font>
<p><font face="arial, arial narrow, helvetica"><font size=-1>CR: MAGIC.
It stands for Meteorological and Geological Information Center. Right above
the door, real big letters. We got a chuckle out of that.</font></font>
<p><font face="arial, arial narrow, helvetica"><font size=-1>LR: We spent
a whole day there copying maps. At the end of the day, we rolled them all
up, put them into two large tubes, and left. We spent that night in Albuquerque.
I had been trying to call the Corn's for a couple of weeks, but kept getting
their recorder. We were not able to connect until that night from the hotel,
when I finally received an answer. Sheila Corn agreed to meet with us on
Saturday morning. It was very nice of her to squeeze us in at 8 a.m. on
a day when her kids had a soccer match. The next day was Friday, and we
spent most of it driving down to Roswell. On Saturday moring, we rose early
and ate breakfast at the Nothin' Fancy restaurant, which had become our
favorite breakfast spot by this time. We decided to get on the road by
7:30, allowing us plenty of time to drive north about 20 miles to the turnoff,
where the 'UFO Crash Site' sign is located. You have probably seen the
sign in books. We arrived at the turnoff at about 7:45 a.m. Remember, the
Corn Ranch is the Randle and Schmidt crash site.</font></font>
<p><font face="arial, arial narrow, helvetica"><font size=-1>We were a
good bit early. In the month of October and there isn't much tourist traffic
out in the desert. Now, I'm talking 'seriously nothing' out in this area.
There are places out in the desert where you could take your radio dial
from one end to the other without picking up anything but dead silence.
Sheila had instructed us to pull off near the 'UFO Crash Site' sign and
wait until she arrived. So there we sat in a rented white jeep, waiting.
There was dead silence. Finally, in the distance we could hear a car approaching.
A vehicle came into sight. It was a red jeep, and it slowed as it got near,
finally pulling in right behind us and parking.</font></font>
<p><font face="arial, arial narrow, helvetica"><font size=-1>CR: Now, we're
sitting in the middle of nowhere -- there isn't even a tree out there.</font></font>
<p><font face="arial, arial narrow, helvetica"><font size=-1>LR: So I get
out of the car and walk back to this jeep, but I can't see inside because
it has dark tinted windows. An automatic window comes down half way, and
I see that this jeep is just full of people. There must have been six people
in there. I said to the driver, You must be Hub,assuming this was our host
for the tour. The driver says 'who?' So, I ask Are you Hub Corn, the owner
of the ranch? He said, no, I never met him. I apologized, and scurried
back to the Jeep. I closed my door and told Curt that it wasn't our host,
and I didn't know who it was.</font></font>
<p><font face="arial, arial narrow, helvetica"><font size=-1>CR: You even
asked him if he was there to meet the Corn's.</font></font>
<p><font face="arial, arial narrow, helvetica"><font size=-1>LR: That's
right. I also asked if he was there for a tour, like us. He said, no, I'm
not here for that. At first, I thought maybe he was just checking his maps,
or he was lost or something. Anyhow, he sat there until after 8:00, a total
of 15 or 20 minutes. He just sat there. At about 8:10 a.m. he backs out
and leaves, and right then Sheila drives up in a white Suburban.</font></font>
<p><font face="arial, arial narrow, helvetica"><font size=-1>KY: So what
do you make of that?</font></font>
<p><font face="arial, arial narrow, helvetica"><font size=-1>LR: What do
you make of it?</font></font>
<p><font face="arial, arial narrow, helvetica"><font size=-1>CR: It's interesting.</font></font>
<p><font face="arial, arial narrow, helvetica"><font size=-1>LR: It's in
our book, just another one of those little stories. We followed Sheila
for several miles. As we got closer, we could immediately recognize the
huge basin that has been a part of many television programs. This was the
place. There's a marked trail with stakes and rope all along it to keep
people on the trail. Up on the rocky wall at the far end of the basin,
they have placed small American flags. This is supposedly where the aliens
died.</font></font>
<p><font face="arial, arial narrow, helvetica"><font size=-1>CR: That's
interesting, too. We have some of the dialogue between ourselves and Sheila
in the book. We asked her many questions, all of which she responded to.
To some, she clearly told us she is not an expert, but she told us of her
understanding.</font></font></ul>

<p align="center"><b>Larry with Sheila Corn at the</b> <b>Corn Ranch crash site </b>taken in 1996<br>
<img border="0" src="sheila.jpg" width="327" height="240"></p>
<ul><font face="arial, arial narrow, helvetica"><font size=-1>CC: Did you
ask her about the other crash sites?</font></font>
<p><font face="arial, arial narrow, helvetica"><font size=-1>CR: Yes, we
surely did. I remember asking where the craft came in from, and she explained
where it ended up. She always qualified herself by saying that she never
had any data that proves what happened at this site, sort of like a disclaimer
by always saying: I'm not an expert, only repeating what I've been told.
She explained how it came in from that way, skipped here and hit the rock
there. I told her that it must have been going pretty fast to skip 35-miles,
and she agreed, saying it was her understanding that it really moving fast.
But it's really interesting that it hit this particular area because of
the area... it's all oil wells through there. Everywhere.</font></font>
<p><font face="arial, arial narrow, helvetica"><font size=-1>CC: How far
from the Gerald Anderson site is that?</font></font>
<p><font face="arial, arial narrow, helvetica"><font size=-1>CR: Oh, that's
Socorro, 125 miles away.</font></font>
<p><font face="arial, arial narrow, helvetica"><font size=-1>LR: That's
the Plains of San Augustin. This may also be a valid site, depending upon
what you have read and believe.</font></font>
<p><font face="arial, arial narrow, helvetica"><font size=-1>CR: Out of
all of these crash sites,there is one that everyone seems to agree upon
-- that something happened at the Corona debris field. It's just a matter
of WHAT happened there. You have that site, the Corn Ranch site (Randle
and Schmidt) which is 35-miles southeast, and the Capitan Mountain (Ragsdale/museum)
site, which is essentially southwest of the Corona debris field, roughly
25 miles.</font></font>
<p><font face="arial, arial narrow, helvetica"><font size=-1>CC: Do you
make a correlation between these sites?</font></font>
<p><font face="arial, arial narrow, helvetica"><font size=-1>CR: Yes. Socorrow
and the Plains of St. Augustin -- they both sit on the 34th parallel latitude.
They are almost on the exact same line as Corona.</font></font>
<p><font face="arial, arial narrow, helvetica"><font size=-1>LR: And, wasn't
there an Air Force base out in that area in those days? South of there
by about 20-miles or so?</font></font>
<p><font face="arial, arial narrow, helvetica"><font size=-1>CR: Not sure.
So, we're looking at many debris fields and many different theories. Some
say two objects collided, going down in different places. That's what is
so confusing to us. How can you have all of these so-called true stories
that are so different?</font></font>
<p><font face="arial, arial narrow, helvetica"><font size=-1>CC: And different
dates, too?</font></font>
<p><font face="arial, arial narrow, helvetica"><font size=-1>CR: The dates
range from June 24 to July 7 or so...</font></font>
<p><font face="arial, arial narrow, helvetica"><font size=-1>CC: And the
number of bodies, too...</font></font>
<p><font face="arial, arial narrow, helvetica"><font size=-1>CR: The number
of bodies vary, but we're not talking about bodies here. We're looking
at where this thing happened, that's the part that blows your mind. How
can all this be? How could Barney Barnett say that he saw this at a certain
time over there and Ragsdale with Trudy in the back of a pickup truck see
something someplace else? Something has got to be wrong here... unless
we had a whole series of UFOs all run into trouble, crashing all over the
place.</font></font>
<p><font face="arial, arial narrow, helvetica"><font size=-1>LR: Instead
of just picking up one book, we reviewed many. They all say different things,
one guy says not to believe what the other guy says. We started wondering:
why would Barnett lie? Why would Ragsdale lie? And we began wondering...</font></font>
<p><font face="arial, arial narrow, helvetica"><font size=-1>CR: What if
they are ALL telling the truth? We have these camps, the Corn Ranch camp
with Schmidt and Randle, and the San Augustin Camp with Friedman, and you
have the Ragsdale Camp... what if they are all telling the truth? Is that
possible? And we're not just talking locations, we're talking what they
saw.</font></font>
<p><font face="arial, arial narrow, helvetica"><font size=-1>KY: So you
had the locations, the general layout of different stories. What enabled
you to connect these elements and draw a larger picture?</font></font>
<p><font face="arial, arial narrow, helvetica"><font size=-1>LR: The thing
that stood out was how none of these witnesses profited from their testimony.
I don't think Ragsdale lied, I don't think Mac Brazel lied about Corona,
I don't think Barney Barnett lied about the Plains of San Augustin, and
I really don't think the people at the Air Force Base lied about what they
saw. I don't think you have any liars here, because nobody profited. There's
no motive to lie...</font></font>
<p><font face="arial, arial narrow, helvetica"><font size=-1>CR: That's
probably how we were able to solve it -- by assuming that the people closest
to the events were not lying, but were in fact telling the truth. We didn't
belong to any camp. We looked at this from a purely scientific standpoint,
from a factual standpoint. And when you ask how they could all be telling
the truth, then your mind begins to work. Then you can make some ground
when you forget about what side you're on. When Larry and I are done here,
we'll have a whole lot of people going down the right track, and that's
scary for some people.</font></font></ul>
