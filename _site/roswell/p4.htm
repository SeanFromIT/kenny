<p><b><font face="Comic Sans MS">CONTINUED</font></b></p>
<p><font size=-1 face="arial, arial narrow, helvetica">KY: Do the debunking
celebrities stand to lose or be embarrassed by your findings?</font> </p>
<p><font size=-1 face="arial, arial narrow, helvetica">CR: Who would
lose by knowing the truth? We've debated that. Everyone gains by knowing
the truth.</font>
<p><font size=-1 face="arial, arial narrow, helvetica">LR: There
is something to the Roswell story.</font>
<p><font size=-1 face="arial, arial narrow, helvetica">CR: It's quite
remarkable. Phenomenal. We found evidence of several different things occurring
in very close proximity... which has perhaps confused people in the past.
That's why when we suspect that perhaps everyone is telling the truth,
maybe they are.</font>
<p><font size=-1 face="arial, arial narrow, helvetica">LR: I haven't
found a liar in this case yet, among the direct witnesses.</font>
<p><font size=-1 face="arial, arial narrow, helvetica">CR: Larry
and I were astounded when we realized what happened. It took us a while
to get used to the idea. We weren't too sure that we really wanted to share
it with people.</font>
<p><font size=-1 face="arial, arial narrow, helvetica">CC: Will this
damage the reputations of historical figures? Such as General Ramey?</font>
<p><font size=-1 face="arial, arial narrow, helvetica">LR: Ramey
said it was a weather balloon.</font>
<p><font size=-1 face="arial, arial narrow, helvetica">CR: If Ramey
said it was a weather balloon, and we say it wasn't a weather balloon,
does that damage him? Sure it does.</font>
<p><font size=-1 face="arial, arial narrow, helvetica">LR: If you
were to ask me if General Ramey KNEW it wasn't a weather balloon when it
WAS a weather balloon...? Remember the saying: <i>I did NOT have sexual
relations with that woman </i>- Will this be the first time in history
that a leader has lied to those he leads? No way.</font>
<p><font size=-1 face="arial, arial narrow, helvetica">CC: What about
Truman and Eisenhower? Did they know?</font>
<p><font size=-1 face="arial, arial narrow, helvetica">CR: We would
SUSPECT that they knew, but we can't answer absolutely.</font>
<p><font size=-1 face="arial, arial narrow, helvetica">CC: Do you
feel there are people out there now that currently know the truth?</font>
<p><font size=-1 face="arial, arial narrow, helvetica">CR: Yes. There
are people out there that know what we know. Those who know are not like
Larry and I, they were most probably involved with this incident to a certain
extent.</font>
<p><font size=-1 face="arial, arial narrow, helvetica">CC: Are the
people who are covering this up doing so for the 'good of the people?'</font>
<p><font size=-1 face="arial, arial narrow, helvetica">CR: No.</font>
<p><font size=-1 face="arial, arial narrow, helvetica">LR: When you
issue an official statement that it was a weather balloon when you know
that it was not a weather balloon, somebody is covering something up.</font>
<p><font size=-1 face="arial, arial narrow, helvetica">CR: It's not
like people have gone out of their way to cover this up. That didn't start
until about 1985, per say.</font>
<p><font size=-1 face="arial, arial narrow, helvetica">LR: The coverup
was so effective.</font>
<p><font size=-1 face="arial, arial narrow, helvetica">CR: People
were sworn to secrecy. They didn't divulge any secrets.</font>
<p><font size=-1 face="arial, arial narrow, helvetica">KY: Would
this be due to a National Security concern?</font>
<p><font size=-1 face="arial, arial narrow, helvetica">CR: Well it's
always due to National Security. In other words, if it's in the best interest
of our nation not to divulge information, that's National Security.</font>
<p><font size=-1 face="arial, arial narrow, helvetica">KY: Can you
comment on any researcher findings where you address the reported 'hieroglyphics'
found on the wreckage?</font>
<p><font size=-1 face="arial, arial narrow, helvetica">LR: We actually
write about that, addressing it head on. It's an important part of the
story... it's very relevant to our explanation.</font>
<p><font size=-1 face="arial, arial narrow, helvetica">CC: Have you
ever felt any concern for your well being while you had conducted this
investigation?</font>
<p><font size=-1 face="arial, arial narrow, helvetica">LR: I'm not
concerned about it at all. There was that one weird day, I was a little
emotional that day. But I don't worry about it.</font>
<p><font size=-1 face="arial, arial narrow, helvetica">CR: There's
too many people that know that Larry and I worked on this, so if something
happened to us that would be... let's put it this way. We're not going
to be on some people's "best list." These are sensitive findings.</font>
<p><font size=-1 face="arial, arial narrow, helvetica">KY: What precautions
have you taken?</font>
<p><font size=-1 face="arial, arial narrow, helvetica">CR: None.
The actual information that is contained in this book is already in the
hands of certain persons, and if something happened to Larry and I, the
details would become known. There is a very good chance that someone else
has a copy besides us.</font>
<p><font size=-1 face="arial, arial narrow, helvetica">KY: What about
the alleged retrieval of a 'corpse' or two from the Roswell incident? How
do your findings stand to effect the people who believe alien corpse's
were retrieved?</font>
<p><font size=-1 face="arial, arial narrow, helvetica">LR: We don't
contradict any testimony. We find nothing to prove that any person was
lying.</font>
<p><font size=-1 face="arial, arial narrow, helvetica">CR: Only Glenn
Dennis knows whether he's telling the truth or not, we would have no reason
to disbelieve him, in fact we find it plausible that he is telling the
truth... and there was a nurse.</font>
<p><font size=-1 face="arial, arial narrow, helvetica">KY: Is there
a connection to the 'monkey situation' where dead monkeys were mistaken
for aliens?</font>
<p><font size=-1 face="arial, arial narrow, helvetica">CR: There
were no monkeys.</font>
<p><font size=-1 face="arial, arial narrow, helvetica">CC: Did they
say humans?</font>
<p><font size=-1 face="arial, arial narrow, helvetica">LR: What did
they say they saw? They were always described as being humanoid.</font>
<p><font size=-1 face="arial, arial narrow, helvetica">CR: I have
researched everything there is, and have not read anything that says they
were not humanoid.</font>
<p><font size=-1 face="arial, arial narrow, helvetica">KY: Where
does the 'extra-terrestrial hypothesis' fit into this. Can you address
any suspicions that something 'otherworldly' happened at Roswell?</font>
<p><font size=-1 face="arial, arial narrow, helvetica">LR: Don't
go by what you read today, but go back to what was said then, from the
original interviews.</font>
<p><font size=-1 face="arial, arial narrow, helvetica">KY: Are you
confident that there were aliens there?</font>
<p><font size=-1 face="arial, arial narrow, helvetica">LR: When it
gets to the point of asking who is this or where did it come from... who
is it's mom and dad... I don't know that. But if you go back and read what
is stated right then... you can believe it.</font>
<p><font size=-1 face="arial, arial narrow, helvetica">CC: I've never
read of any accounts from 1947 regarding humanoid reports from Roswell...</font>
<p><font size=-1 face="arial, arial narrow, helvetica">LR: Read what
Glenn Dennis said the nurse told him.</font>
<p><font size=-1 face="arial, arial narrow, helvetica">CC: The six-fingered
alien with little pads on its fingers?</font>
<p><font size=-1 face="arial, arial narrow, helvetica">CR: One of
the hands was severed...</font>
<p><font size=-1 face="arial, arial narrow, helvetica">LR: The closer
it is to the time of the event, the more accurate the description. Now
if it's the second-cousin to the uncle who sat on the schoolbus next to
the grandfather of the person who saw it -- don't believe it.</font>
<p><font size=-1 face="arial, arial narrow, helvetica">CR: How many
bodies?</font>
<p><font size=-1 face="arial, arial narrow, helvetica">LR: There
are differing accounts. Some say four, some say five or six.</font>
<p><font size=-1 face="arial, arial narrow, helvetica">CC: Do you
feel there have been craft that has crashed elsewhere?</font>
<p><font size=-1 face="arial, arial narrow, helvetica">LR: There's
a lot of stuff going on out there, no doubt about it.</font>
<p><font size=-1 face="arial, arial narrow, helvetica">CR: Nothing
we can prove.</font>
<p><font size=-1 face="arial, arial narrow, helvetica">KY: We had
discussed Dorothy Kilgallen during an earlier, private discussion. During
a 1953 newspaper article, she referenced a British source that disclosed
information to her about the retrieval of aliens. What -from this- can
be drawn into your research?</font>
<p><font size=-1 face="arial, arial narrow, helvetica">CR: We wanted
to know who the British source was. Somebody told Dorothy this, a Statesperson.
Larry and I looked at this and wanted to know WHO told Dorothy this story,
and more so, we wanted to know WHY they told her this story. The WHY is
more important than the WHO. We don't say whatever they told her was true
or untrue, we look at this issue and ask WHY she was told this. It's not
WHAT they told her.</font>
<p><font size=-1 face="arial, arial narrow, helvetica">CC: Were there
others reporting similar things during this time period?</font>
<p><font size=-1 face="arial, arial narrow, helvetica">LR: No, it
was quiet.</font>
<p><font size=-1 face="arial, arial narrow, helvetica">CR: But we
want to know why.</font>
<p><font size=-1 face="arial, arial narrow, helvetica">KY: What steps
have you taken to secure a publisher?</font>
<p><font size=-1 face="arial, arial narrow, helvetica">LR: We are
obviously not writers, for we have taken all the wrong steps. We thought
we had a story that was so timely and important that publishers would come
to us. That's how naive we were. When we realized that wouldn't happen,
we took the first step in contacting a few publishers and they said "go
away and play by the rules." You have to have a query letter and chapter,
etcetera, that's the way this industry works. If it was possible to do
it wrong, we've done it wrong. It's a business like any other.</font>
<p><font size=-1 face="arial, arial narrow, helvetica">CR: They want
us to tell them the whole story before they agree to publish.</font>
<p><font size=-1 face="arial, arial narrow, helvetica">LR: There
is a book proposal format that has to be followed, asking what the topic
is and where it fits in the Library of Congress, then you have to attach
one or two chapters. We did write a new chapter exclusively to use in this
process. We've talked to two different movie studios... both called us.
One talked to use for about two hours one night trying to beat us down,
but we wouldn't tell them the story.</font>
<p><font size=-1 face="arial, arial narrow, helvetica">CR: We offered
to go to California and New York to sit down with someone who would read
it in front of us. We would only allow them to read it in our presence.
If they didn't want to publish it, they would have to forget everything
they've read. It's frustrating. If it is right for the story to be told,
then it will be told. If it's not, it won't. If I were to tell you the
whole story right now of what happened at Roswell, you wouldn't be able
to stand it. You would be on the phone within four minutes of leaving here
and everyone would know what happened.</font>
<p><font size=-1 face="arial, arial narrow, helvetica">CC: How will
religious people view your evidence? Will they be greatly upset by it?</font>
<p><font size=-1 face="arial, arial narrow, helvetica">LR: We really
don't have any way of knowing that.</font>
<p><font size=-1 face="arial, arial narrow, helvetica">CC: So they
won't be jumping off of buildings or anything?</font>
<p><font size=-1 face="arial, arial narrow, helvetica">CR: I don't
know, WE may get pushed off a building or two. These findings may spin
you around in a circle a couple of times and set you back down, but it
depends upon your psychological makeup.</font>
<p><font size=-1 face="arial, arial narrow, helvetica">LR: What percentage
of the population would really care? I don't know.</font>
<p><font size=-1 face="arial, arial narrow, helvetica">KY: When will
the book be due?</font>
<p><font size=-1 face="arial, arial narrow, helvetica">LR: It takes
three to six months to get through the review process. I could be sitting
here six months from now going through a dozen rejection letters, scratching
my head saying: "Go figure."</font>
<p><font size=-1 face="arial, arial narrow, helvetica">CR: We haven't
been out there beating doors down. To us, the money doesn't mean all that
much, we would like to retire someday and have a little extra, but this
isn't going to be it. But while it's not the money, it's also the idea
that Larry and I don't necessarily need the notoriety.</font>
<p><font size=-1 face="arial, arial narrow, helvetica">LR: We could
never publish under 'assumed names.'</font>
<p align="center">
<img border="0" src="Curtquote.jpg" width="398" height="244" align="right"></p>
<p><font size=-1 face="arial, arial narrow, helvetica">KY: Why 'Ice
Man Down?' What is the significance of the title?</font>
<p><font size=-1 face="arial, arial narrow, helvetica">LR: There
are two tracks through the book. There is the track about all the strange
things that happened to us, and then there is the other track that is the
historical track. There are passages that we wrote to make the historical
track a continuous one, and these passages we call 'scenarios.' In one
or more of these scenarios, we discuss a teletype message that came down
from headquarters. Well, we don't have an exact teletype message which
may have come from headquarters, but we know that this information got
from this person to that person, and it was probably a teletype message.
The Air Force and The Army always had code-names they used, and Ice Man
was a CODE-NAME. A made-up code-name. It has a significance that you wouldn't
realize if you weren't involved.</font>
<p><font size=-1 face="arial, arial narrow, helvetica">KY: Do you
fear someone else coming up with the answer before your book is published?</font>
<p><font size=-1 face="arial, arial narrow, helvetica">LR: There's
no information anyone can gather based on what was said during this interview,
but I'm not naive enough to think that there aren't other people out there
that are interested in this topic like we are that could come to these
conclusions.</font>
<p><font size=-1 face="arial, arial narrow, helvetica">CC: Will anyone
be brought out of the woodwork that will have to give an account for themselves?</font>
<p><font size=-1 face="arial, arial narrow, helvetica">CR: Well many
of the people involved are no longer with us. This was more than fifty
years ago, and some of the people who were sworn to secrecy might yet come
forward, but there's probably not too many around.</font>
<p><font size=-1 face="arial, arial narrow, helvetica">CC: What are
the key questions you would ask if you met one of these persons?</font>
<p><font size=-1 face="arial, arial narrow, helvetica">CR: I'd just
look them right in the eye and smile, because then they would know that
we know. That smile would be enough. And they wouldn't be able to stand
it...</font>
<p><font size=-1 face="arial, arial narrow, helvetica">KY: Will the
readers be satisfied or disappointed?</font>
<p><font size=-1 face="arial, arial narrow, helvetica">CR: Golly,
that depends on what camp they belong to, I guess. We don't belong to any
camp.</font>
<p><font size=-1 face="arial, arial narrow, helvetica">LR: It's really
easy to follow this book, you won't have to be a rocket scientists to read
this. I think people will like the way this research is conducted.</font>
<p><font size=-1 face="arial, arial narrow, helvetica">CC: Do you
feel good about this research and what you have come across?</font>
<p><font size=-1 face="arial, arial narrow, helvetica">LR: Just speaking
for me... I never feel happy with anything I do, I don't know why. This
book is the same way. I really wish I knew a little more about this or
that. But overall, our answer is right.</font>
<p><font size=-1 face="arial, arial narrow, helvetica">CR: We're
still working on it. It's not done, like anything. We haven't found the
borders to the puzzle. But there are some areas where we have a real good
feeling about what we have learned.</font>
<p><font size=-1 face="arial, arial narrow, helvetica">KY: Thanks
for the interview. We'll be looking forward to the book.</font>
<p><font size=-1 face="arial, arial narrow, helvetica">LR: Thank
you.</font>

<p><b><font size=+2>Additional Comment:</font> </b>
<p><b>I met with Curt and Larry several times prior to this interview.
I am impressed with their sincerity and credibility. They have told of
the 'Keepers of The Secret' who work still today to conceal the truth of
The Roswell Incident. The Keepers have much to hide, and a great embarrassment
to gain. While writing this book, they claim that an office has been broken
into... and they have been followed.</b>
<p><b>Both Curt and Larry claim to sleep well at night, that their findings
have not induced a climate of panic or fear in their lives. They do claim,
however, to see things with a different outlook. They do not think the
Roswell Revelation will unravel society or induce panic.</b>
<p><b>They speak with rock-solid assurance of having the final answer to
this legendary mystery.</b>
<p><b>Whether otherworldly beings were involved at Roswell they will not
elaborate upon as of yet. They simply say: "There's something for everyone
in this book."</b>
<p><b>They believe their findings could re-write history. Based upon my
conversations with these gentlemen, I strongly suspect they could have
some information which may be potentially explosive.</b>
