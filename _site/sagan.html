<br><b><i><font size=+2>Cincinnati weatherman: "Sagan said UFOs from Moon!"</font></i></b>
<p><i><font size=-1>Enclosed below is a re-typed 1965 newspaper article.
There are portions of the article which are</font></i>
<br><i><font size=-1>simply not legible. These portions are noted, as I
could not 'make the connections' by presuming to</font></i>
<br><i><font size=-1>insert what was not readable.</font></i><i><font size=-1></font></i>
<p><i><font size=-1>The article, written by Cincinnati Post columnist [for
36-years] Mary Wood, quotes WLWT Channel-5 meteorologist Frank Pierce,
who recounts some odd comments allegedly made by Carl Sagan concerning
UFOs. Pierce was chief meteorologist for WLWT Channel 5 [NBC] in Cincinnati
for many years. Wood also adds that Pierce was involved at the first Air
Force office in the Pentagon during the '47 &amp; '48 time-period.</font></i><i><font size=-1></font></i>
<p><i><font size=-1>I once tried to locate Pierce to inquire further about
this issue, but could not locate him. There</font></i>
<br><i><font size=-1>are two obituary items for a Frank Pierce found in
an index of Cincinnati newspapers, so it may be</font></i>
<br><i><font size=-1>likely that he has passed away.</font></i><i><font size=-1></font></i>

<p><i><font size=-1>It doesn't seem likely that such a comment ever came
from Sagan but through private discussion, as I</font></i>
<br><i><font size=-1>have not heard of anything like this from him [publicly,
that is] before. Would anyone have any</font></i>
<br><i><font size=-1>information that Pierce was an associate or shared
correspondence with Sagan?</font></i><i><font size=-1></font></i>

<i>By Mary Wood</i>
<p>Frank Edwards, whose new book "Flying Saucers - A Serious Business"
is a bestseller, has been in
<br>town all week appearing on Ch. 5 shows to talk about UFOs. Since I
recently read Edwards' book and was immediately converted from being a
skeptic about Flying Saucers into a firm believer, I was
<br>anxious to meet Frank.
<p>Actually, it was Ch. 5's weatherman, Frank Pierce, who first stimulated
my interest in UFOs when he talked about them during an interview we had
several months ago. Pierce is a pure scientist and the last man to ever
go off on flights of fancy. He was also in the first Air Force office at
the
<br>Pentagon in 1947 and '48, which was set up to handle UFO information.
Frank is a believer and
<br>insists that about three percent of all UFO sightings cannot be identified
by anyone.
<p>"The government admits that they are there, but can't explain them,"
said Pierce. "Anybody connected with UFO investigation knows that there
are unexplained objects."
<p>I had lunch with the two Franks -Pierce and Edwards- this week and listened
avidly to their
<br>discussion.
<p>'That three percent that the Air Force admits to does not include 700
UFO sightings that I know they have reports on, but which they haven't
revealed," argued Edwards. "Why should we assume that somewhere in our
galaxy there does not exist a civilization far in advance of ours? Only
eight years ago, we couldn't get a four-pound satellite off the launching
pad at Cape Canaveral, but today we have conquered space.
<p>Frank Pierce [text illegible] a bit of news about [illegible] UFO investigations.
<p>"From now&nbsp; on, [illegible] investigation will [illegible] away
from the [illegible] he told me.

<br>[illegible] will be divided into sectors, with [illegible] scientists
[illegible]
<p>I asked why the Government had taken such a hush-hush approach to UFOs
in the past.
<p>"It's very simple," Edwards explained. "In July, 1952, when UFOs swarmed
over Washington, D.C., the Air Force either had to admit they were there
and couldn't do anything about them, or deny that they were there. They
chose to deny."
<p>I wondered if either Pierce or Edwards had any inkling from which planet
the Flying Saucers
<br>originated? They both said they didn't nor did anyone else.
<p>"But Dr. Carl Sagan, adviser on Extra-Terrestrial life for the Armed
Services, said we must assume
<br>that they have bases on the other said of the Moon," said Pierce.
<p>"We should also assume that our life span may not be as long as the
life span on other planets,"
<br>added Edwards.
<p>Frank Pierce says he is skeptical about humanoids manning UFOs- "Before
I will believe there are
<br>humanoids I'll have to see on," said Pierce. Frank Edwards, on the
other hand, is convinced that
<br>humanoids exist and have been seen.
<p>"Too many credible witnesses in all parts of the world have seen them
and describe the same people," said Edwards. "According to scientists that
I know, we will make contact with The Humanoids within three years."
