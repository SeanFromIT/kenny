Some residents reportstrange lights</font></b><br><b><font size=+1>By BROOKE BUNCH</font></b><br><b><font size=+1>Chillicothe (Ohio) Gazette</font></b><br><b><font size=+1>Gazette Staff Writer</font></b><br><b><font size=+1>Oct 19, 2003</font></b><b><font size=+1></font></b><p><b><font size=+1>It's a bird!&nbsp; It's a plane!&nbsp; It's a ... UFO?</font></b><b><font size=+1></font></b><p><b><font size=+1>Local residents reported an Unidentified Flying ObjectFriday night while attending a Unioto football game. An unexplainable seriesof lights lit up the night sky according to Lonnie Caplinger and his sonBruce.</font></b><b><font size=+1></font></b><p><b><font size=+1>"I couldn't believe it," Bruce said. "It was too weird.It just makes you wonder what's going on out there."</font></b><b><font size=+1></font></b><p><b><font size=+1>According to Bruce, he just happened to be lookingup at the sky when he saw two bright lights that appeared to be movingtoward him.&nbsp; "Then of all of sudden, a third one appeared, then afourth one, almost like a tear drop dropping out of the other one," hesaid. "They were in a horizontal line, four bright lights. Then they slowlyturned orange and just disappeared."</font></b><b><font size=+1></font></b><p><b><font size=+1>Bruce said the Friday night sighting was almost identicalto what he saw seven years ago, a reporting of strange lights in the skywhich was recorded by a Ross County man and then broadcast on Channel 10News.</font></b><b><font size=+1></font></b><p><b><font size=+1>"Coincidentally it was in the same area," Bruce said,"and at the same time of year."</font></b><b><font size=+1></font></b><p><b><font size=+1>But as Lonnie pointed out, what happened after theFriday sighting was far from comparable.</font></b><b><font size=+1></font></b><p><b><font size=+1>According to Lonnie, about 20 minutes after he witnessedthe third series of lights, which happened in a period of 12 to 13 minutes,he saw what he thought were two fighter planes circling the area.</font></b><b><font size=+1></font></b><p><b><font size=+1>"Evidently they were from Wright Patterson (Air ForceBase)," he said. "They came at a high rate of speed. They circled the areafor several minutes and left."</font></b><b><font size=+1></font></b><p><b><font size=+1>Lonnie said the series of unidentified lights almostlooked like a plane with four lights strung across the wing.</font></b><b><font size=+1></font></b><p><b><font size=+1>"But if it was a plane it was huge, huge, huge," hesaid. Friday's night sighting was the third reported locally since 1986,when Barbara Herrnstein witnessed inexplicable lights during a sessionof stargazing.</font></b><b><font size=+1></font></b><p><b><font size=+1>According to Crystal Lavadour, from the office of publicaffairs of Wright Patterson Air Force Base in Dayton, there were no reportsof strange lights Friday evening, and no calls were reported locally accordingto the Ross County Sheriff's office.</font></b><b><font size=+1></font></b><p><b><font size=+1>Lonnie stands behind his allegation. Unexplainableor not, what he witnessed at a Friday night football game was real, hesaid, and perhaps ... alive.</font></b><b><font size=+1></font></b><p><b><font size=+1>"I believe there are other life forms," he said. "Thereare too many strange things that can't be explained."</font></b><p><hr WIDTH="100%"><p><i>SPECIAL NOTE:</i><i></i><p><i>It is my suspicion that the object sighted over Ross County, Ohiocould be flares deployed from military jets.

For some in Geauga County, it mighthave been more than a thought when they saw something glowing.<p>NewsChannel5's Leon Bibb went in search of unidentified flying objects.<p>It was in Huntsburg in Geauga County late one August evening when nature'sdark ceiling was the backdrop of strange movements in the sky, Bibb reported.<p>"A light hovering above our woods," said Michele Braun.<p>Braun and her daughter, Stephanie, recounted the story on Aug. 29. Neighborkids had a backyard bonfire going. But in the distance away from the risingsmoke came unusual movement. Those who saw it could neither judge its distanceaway nor its size, saying they only know what they saw.<p>"It would start off like a little ball, like a little white light comingtoward us and then it come like a half-circle, a rod," Braun said.<p>From the backyard gathering, a boy grabbed his video camera. So Bibboffered the tale of his tape. It was an eerie sight unfolding, like a fieryball which changes its shape, Bibb said. Rven the family dog became unnerved.<p>"Just like going in circles and then she jumped on my mom; on her shoulderand then on her head. Like it was weird," Stephanie Braun said.<p>Just off Chardon-Windsor Road in Huntsburg there have been other accountsof mysterious events, Bibb said.
