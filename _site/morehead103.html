Rescue Sq. had a call from MoreheadPolice Dept. of a female crying for help three times&nbsp; From 2 witnessthen they was a bright light in the sky for about 1 min. RESCUE SQ. arrivedon scene and started searching the area 1st &amp; 2nd witness reportedseeing this .The fire dept. was ask to begin searching with the thermalimaging camera with no results found. Res. of Morehead was one of the witnesses.Unless there is a confirmed report of a missing person, the search willnot be continued."<br>&nbsp;<p><b><font size=+1>INVESTIGATION</font></b><p>This morning I contacted the Morehead Police Dept. at (606-784-7511)and talked to two very nice officers that were in the department (locatedat 105 E Main St. Morehead, KY).<p>I asked the first dispatcher if he could provide any information aboutan unusual report I had concerning mysterious lights seen near Morehead.<p>"I think that was from the Rockfork area," he said, "and it was thenorthern lights, what they call an aurora. We had some calls on it. Wehad a report of the northern lights in the area."<p>The dispatcher also informed that no officers reported the lights.<p>"There were some calls on it, one female caller reporting somethingin the sky, but it was the aurora borealis."<p>I asked if the calls were related to the report of "screaming sounds"and the dispatcher said he did not think so.<p>I asked if there was a search conducted and he did not know for sureand began checking the logs. There was some confusion as to the date ofevent but found from his logbook he informed that a search was undertakennear Adams Lane on Sunday evening, November 23.<p>"There was some type of search because of a woman screaming, I think,"he said, and also checked with another gentleman who was in the office,the captain of the fire department. I could overhear the gentleman<br>talking (his name may have been Randy) who was knowledgeable aboutthe situation. I then asked if I could speak directly with this person.<p>The Captain of the Fire Department came to the phone and said that onSunday night, November 23, persons near Adams Lane began hearing a womanscreaming three times around 10:00 p.m.<p>"We had a report of a woman screaming and then they didn't hear it nomore," said the Morehead, KY fire official, "they called and the localrescue squad went out there, the fire department and the police went outand a search was conducted. The search used a thermal imaging device andlasted for about an hour and a half when it was called off."<p>"We thought it might have been two kids who got scared," he said. "Maybeone scared another and they were frightened."<p>I asked the fire official if he had any knowledge about the bright lightin the sky seen for one minute and he said: "I got there at the tail endof things so don't know anything about it. I didn't see anything myself."<p>I asked if he heard anyone else talking or rumors of a bright lightin the sky during the time frame of the search and he said "no."<p><b><font size=+1>COMMENT</font></b><p>The two officers at the Morehead Police Department were kind and helpful.They were able to validate the report of 'mysterious screams' that appearedon N.U.F.O.R.C. but did not have any information to link the 3 mysteriousscreams directly to a sighting of a 'bright light' in the sky.<p>The first officer said the bright light, seen a couple of days earlier,was caused by the Northern Lights or Aurora Borealis, yet it seems unusualto think that several residents, as described, would see a nice colorfulcloud or a pretty sunset and interpret the situation in such a strangemanner as to feel the need to contact local police authorities.<p>Further, the initial report to N.U.F.O.R.C. sought to link the sightingof the bright light in the sky directly to the scream/search event andseemed to suggest that a "Res." of Morehead was one of the witnesses. "Res."might mean 'resident' or 'rescue' as in rescue worker. The poorly wordedreport also does not indicate what this 'Res.' was a witness to, exactly.<p>Also, there may be some issue as to the time listed on the N.U.F.O.R.C.report as the claimant logs the event as occurring on 11/21/2003 when thedispatcher said the search took place Sunday evening, 11/23/2003 (and alsonoted that the northern lights were seen "a couple of days earlier").<p>Northern Lights have been prominent lately due to increased solar eruptionsand flares from the sun.<p>Filed,<br>November 27, 2003<br>KENNY YOUNG<br>--<br>UFO Research<br>https://home.fuse.net/ufo<p><hr WIDTH="100%"><b><font face="Arial,Helvetica"></font></b><center><p><b><font face="Arial,Helvetica"><a href="https://kenny.anomalyresponse.com/moreheadindex.html">RETURNTO THE MOREHEAD INCIDENT INDEX PAGE</a></font></b><br><br><hr WIDTH="100%"><br><br><b><font face="Arial,Helvetica">UFO RESEARCH</font></b><br><b><font face="Arial,Helvetica"><a href="https://home.fuse.net/ufo">Returnto MAIN PAGE</a> |&nbsp; <a href="mailto:anomalyresponse@gmail.com">E-mail Questionsor Comments</a></font></b></center></td></tr></table></center><br>&nbsp;<br>&nbsp;</body></html>
