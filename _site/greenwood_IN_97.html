Two days later on Friday, October 3, he placed a phone callto Wright-Patterson Air Force Base on his own initiative, seeking to reportthe UFO sighting.&nbsp; He was referred to the Cincinnati UFO Hotline withthis concern.&nbsp;</font></b><b><font face="Arial,Helvetica"></font></b><p><b><font face="Arial,Helvetica">The 'Senior Enlisted Man' was interviewedon Saturday, October 4 and Sunday, October 5 by telephone. He was veryknowledgeable, kind, and gladly willing to submit this report.&nbsp;</font></b><b><font face="Arial,Helvetica"></font></b><p><b><font face="Arial,Helvetica">On Wednesday night, October 1st between8:00 and 8:30 p.m., C.S.T. this gentleman, who sought to be referred tosimply as a 'Senior Enlisted Man' working at the Reserve Station in Indianapolis,Indiana, saw what he believed to be a UFO. He is a Vietnam and Gulf Warveteran.</font></b><b><font face="Arial,Helvetica"></font></b><p><b><font face="Arial,Helvetica">It was from his vantage point on theoutskirts of Indianapolis (city of Greenwood, Johnson County), that the'Senior Enlisted Man' (whose name will not be disclosed for this report)witnessed the aerial anomaly that he could not identify. He was lookingto the south-east and a brightly-lit object 75 to 80-degrees in the skycaught his attention.&nbsp;</font></b><b><font face="Arial,Helvetica"></font></b><p><b><font face="Arial,Helvetica">The object looked like a star at firstbut continued to grow in intensity, until it reached an extremely intense"pure white" state which lasted about 15 seconds.&nbsp;</font></b><b><font face="Arial,Helvetica"></font></b><p><b><font face="Arial,Helvetica">"After that, the object grew dimmeras it appeared to move up and away from my view until it finally was lostfrom my sight," he said.&nbsp;</font></b><b><font face="Arial,Helvetica"></font></b><p><b><font face="Arial,Helvetica">The Petty Officer drew the comparisonto a construction-site light; the high intensity type "white lights" thatroad construction crews use to light their work areas with at night.&nbsp;</font></b><b><font face="Arial,Helvetica"></font></b><p><b><font face="Arial,Helvetica">He added that there is a small airparknear there, and planes were conducting 'touch and go' maneuvers at thetime, but categorically discounted any possibility that this air trafficwould have caused the spectacle reported. The air park was located to thenorth-east of the viewing area and the type of planes located there couldnot possibly have attained the attitude acquired by what was viewed.&nbsp;</font></b><b><font face="Arial,Helvetica"></font></b><p><b><font face="Arial,Helvetica">When asked if the object could havebeen a missile, he said that he witnessed the object in the sky, and didnot see the object near ground or any indications of a launch, so he couldnot speculate on any missile possibilities. There was no visible trailor audible jet noise. He could not determine how near to his position theobject could have been.&nbsp;</font></b><b><font face="Arial,Helvetica"></font></b><p><b><font face="Arial,Helvetica">When asked of his familiarity with flaresutilized by the military, he replied that he is very knowledgeable withthe current inventory of military flares and has viewed many during hiscareer in the military and most recently at Camp Atterbury, a Army NationalGuard Training Center, South of Indianapolis, IN. Crane Naval Weapons Centerwas ruled out as a source of the light due to its distance and locationfrom the sighting area.&nbsp;</font></b><b><font face="Arial,Helvetica"></font></b><p><b><font face="Arial,Helvetica">Weather conditions: Darkness Clear skiesNo moon visible&nbsp;</font></b><b><font face="Arial,Helvetica"></font></b><p><b><font face="Arial,Helvetica">When asked if he had previous sightings,he said that in May of 1985 in Kansas, he had seen a meteor flash throughthe sky that impressed him.&nbsp;</font></b><b><font face="Arial,Helvetica"></font></b><p><b><font face="Arial,Helvetica">123-miles southeast of this location,a UFO sighting was claimed near Frankfort, Kentucky just hours later.

The sighter, an employee of a Kroger Supermarket onthe east side of Frankfort (Franklin County), advised of sighting a lightin the sky to the west of his location, which moved from side to side sofast that it left a notable streak. The object departed by blinking andclimbing straight up (this descriptive characteristic is similar to a JohnsonCounty, Indiana report which had been received several hours earlier).&nbsp;<p><hr WIDTH="100%"><p><i>Newspaper Article, courtesy of Joe Ritrovato&nbsp;</i><br><i>A Good Night To View Mir, Atlantis Duet&nbsp;</i><br><i>The San Francisco Chronicle October 2, 1997&nbsp;</i><i></i><p><i>If skies are clear this evening, Bay Area residents will be ableto watch the Mir space station and shuttle Atlantis pass overhead.&nbsp;</i><i></i><p><i>No binoculars are needed. ``This should be one of the best passesever. It will be very bright, like Venus,'' said David Rodriguez, programdirector of the East Bay Astronomical Society at Chabot Observatory inOakland.&nbsp;</i><i></i><p><i>The linked shuttle and space station are calculated to go over theBay Area, moving from the southwest to northeast, with peak visibilityat 8:25 p.m. They should appear above the southwest horizon at about 8:22.A few seconds after passing overhead, they will disappear from sight.&nbsp;</i><i></i><p><i>The shuttle is to separate from Mir tomorrow. However, Mir will continueto be visible in the Bay Area tomorrow, Saturday and Sunday evenings.&nbsp;</i><i></i><p><i>Tomorrow, Mir moves from southwest to southeast, appearing at 7:25and rising about one- third of the way from the horizon. Saturday, Mirwill cross to the northwest, with peak visibility at 8:07.
