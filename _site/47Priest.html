<font face="Arial Narrow"><font size=+1><b>Chicago, July 6 - (UP)</b> A
Catholic priest at Grafton, Wis., said tonight that a round, metal disc,
which might be one of the mysterious "flying saucers," had crashed into
his parish yard and that he is holding it for the federal bureau of investigation.</font></font>
<p><font face="Arial Narrow"><font size=+1>Rev. Joseph Brasky of St. Joseph's
church at Grafton, 45 miles north of Milwaukee, said he heard a swishing
and whirring noise this morning. A second later, he said, he heard a thud
and a mild explosion.</font></font>
<p><font face="Arial Narrow"><font size=+1>He investigated and found a
sheet metal disc about 18 inches in diameter, resembling a circular saw
blade.</font></font>
<p><font face="Arial Narrow"><font size=+1>"The object still was warm,
weighed about four or five pounds and was about one-eighth of an inch thick,"
he said.</font></font>
<p><font face="Arial Narrow"><font size=+1>There was a hole about one inch
in diameter in the middle of the disc, he said, and in the opening were
"gadgets and some wires."</font></font>
<p><font face="Arial Narrow"><font size=+1>Brasky said he did not see the
object while it was in the air, and observers said that it would appear
as only a speck in the distance if persons on the ground had seen it in
the sky.</font></font>
<p><font face="Arial Narrow"><font size=+1>The priest said he did not know
if his discovery were important, or whether it might be an elaborate practical
joke. He said he had notified the FBI of his find. H. K. Johnson of the
Milwaukee FBI office said he hadn't heard yet about the disc but that an
official report might be at his office.</font></font>

<p><font face="Arial Narrow"><font size=+1>The Rev. Joseph Brasky, a Catholic
priest of Grafton, Wis., reported that a metal disc 18 inches in diameter
with "gadgets and wires" around the hole in the center crashed into his
yard with a mild explosion. He announced he was holding it for the FBI,
but after close examination found the lettering "... steel, high carbon,
100 per cent steel," and decided that it was a circular saw blade.</font></font>

<font face="Arial Narrow"><font size=+1>Grafton, Wis. � Father Joseph Brasky,
pastor of the St. Joseph�s Church at Grafton, Wis., is shown holding the
strange disk which hit a lightning rod atop his church. From there it spun
to the ground. Father Brasky, who points to the lightning rod which was
hit, says the disk �it looks like a buzz saw from here- fell with a roar,
and immediately after it was too hot to handle. Flying saucers, mystery
missiles, have been reported seen by hundreds of persons coast to coast.</font></font><font face="Arial Narrow"><font size=+1></font></font>
