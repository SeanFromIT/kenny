No unusual or foreign materials weredetected on the charred and unburned areas of the branches.&nbsp; The resultsshow normal natural products from trees and normal burn byproducts.&nbsp;&nbsp;The natural products include primarily celluloidal material, some naturalester, a small amount of secondary amide, and trace amounts of possiblenatural carboxylic acid salts.&nbsp;&nbsp; Burning byproducts include carbon,calcium carbonate, calcium phosphate, inorganic nitrate, and organic oxidationproducts, which are primarily carboxylic acid salts.</font><p><font face="Arial,Helvetica">2.) It is worth noting that there are noradioactive or fluorescing materials.&nbsp;&nbsp; It is reassuring to knowradioactivity is absent.</font><p><font face="Arial,Helvetica">3.)
