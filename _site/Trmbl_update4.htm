<P><FONT COLOR="#FFFF00"><FONT SIZE=+1>Discussions with the reporter from
Youngstown TV-Ch. 33</FONT></FONT> </P>

<P><FONT COLOR="#FFFF00"><FONT SIZE=-1>Delving further into the mysterious
affairs surrounding the 1994 Trumbull County Disturbance, I contacted a
Ms. Stacey Adger, a news reporter with WYTV Channel 33 in Youngstown, Ohio.
Adger is the reporter whose voice is heard on the 9-1-1 tapes, inquiring
with the Trumbull County dispatch headquarters of the UFO situation.</FONT></FONT></P>

<P><FONT COLOR="#FFFF00"><FONT SIZE=-1>I first spoke with Stacey Adger
on June 8, 1998, and asked her why this story was never reported, and how
such an incredible event could have been kept so quiet for so long.</FONT></FONT></P>

<P><FONT COLOR="#FFFF00"><FONT SIZE=-1>She said that she was off of work
in the two days following the incident, and nobody else ever 'reported'
on the situation. She said that while she was off, she &quot;did some checking&quot;

into the story, but nobody would tell her anything. She added that she
was fully aware of the numerous UFO reports and the police pursuit of an
unknown object.</FONT></FONT></P>

<P><FONT COLOR="#FFFF00"><FONT SIZE=-1>I asked Stacey about the FAA involvement
with the report, and where the FAA tower was in relation to the airbase.
She said the airbase and airport are both in Vienna, Ohio, adjacent to
one another. This is the same area where the UFO was sighted. Adger said
that if the security guard was visually observing the UFO from his vantage
point at the airport, there is &quot;no way&quot; the FAA tower could NOT
observe the UFO, especially from a 70-foot elevation and using binoculars.</FONT></FONT></P>

<P><FONT COLOR="#FFFF00"><FONT SIZE=-1>She was aware that a Howland police
officer was standing alongside a security officer at the airbase and both
were observing the UFO. Neither could identify the object.</FONT></FONT></P>

<P><FONT COLOR="#FFFF00"><FONT SIZE=-1>Stacey said that she called the
airport herself that night, and talked with the same FAA tower operator
who was on the tape. This man told her that 'people were pulling pranks'
and there was nothing on radar.</FONT></FONT></P>

<P><FONT COLOR="#FFFF00"><FONT SIZE=-1>She recalled the first woman who
phoned in, and said that the woman was extremely scared. The woman described
the UFO as a bluish-green object that was real close to the ground, and
had lights associated with it.</FONT></FONT></P>

<P><FONT COLOR="#FFFF00"><FONT SIZE=-1>I told Stacey that I had been advised
by the 9-1-1 telecommunicator (who furnished me the tape) that she was
also going to be sent a copy, and we would be the only two recipients,
aside from several police officers who wanted a copy for their own curiousity.
I asked her if she had received her copy, and she said that she did. She
said she has listened to it 5 or 6 times now, and each time was thunderstruck
by what she heard.</FONT></FONT></P>

<P><FONT COLOR="#FFFF00"><FONT SIZE=-1>I asked if she conveyed information
of this to others, and she said that she has not. She announced that she
was the only person in the news media who had the tape.</FONT></FONT></P>

<P><FONT COLOR="#FFFF00"><FONT SIZE=-1>She has not told anyone about it,
because she &quot;wanted to check with certain persons involved,&quot;
whose careers may be in jeopardy, she was inclined to suspect. Evidently,
she was given to believe that the tapes were removed from the regular storage
area and were hidden in another part of the 9-1-1 center. Adger felt that
the tapes may have been hidden purposefully.</FONT></FONT></P>

<P><FONT COLOR="#FFFF00"><FONT SIZE=-1>Yours truly was also told by one
of the telecommunicators that the tapes were mysteriously 'misplaced' in
another location, or lost altogether. The telecommunicator expressed to
me that when he noticed the tapes missing, he was 'spooked.' He did not,
however, interpret this as a conspiratorial act, because he said there
was a 'backup' tape located elsewhere that he was able to retrieve. The
exact circumstances surrounding this situation is still unclear, but there
was a definite problem which surfaced when the tapes were initially sought
for retrieval. </FONT></FONT></P>

<P><FONT COLOR="#FFFF00"><FONT SIZE=-1>Adger thought that any reportage
of this incident may have grand ramifications. She also was aware of the
re-assignment of the air traffic controllers at the Youngstown FAA after
the UFO incident.</FONT></FONT></P>

<P><FONT COLOR="#FFFF00"><FONT SIZE=-1>During my June 8 discussion with
Stacey Adger, she said that her managing editors are not aware of this
situation, and she didn't have any plan on when or how to tell them. She
feared that the News Director may &quot;hop all over&quot; the story with
a motivation not to focus on the UFO incident, but to wrongfully characterize
the 9-1-1 center in a false light.</FONT></FONT></P>

<P><FONT COLOR="#FFFF00"><FONT SIZE=-1>I spoke with Stacey Adger again
on June 12, and still she gave no indication that this story is being pursued,
or that she has given the information to the News Director. She did say
that her initial estimation that the tapes were deliberately concealed
by the management of the 9-1-1 center were 'probably incorrect.'</FONT></FONT></P>

<P><FONT COLOR="#FFFF00"><FONT SIZE=-1>In my reflections of this entire
situation, the news staff of WYTV Channel 33 in Youngstown, Ohio is largely
to blame for this story being concealed from the public so. Certain persons
on the news staff have been in full possession, from the beginning, of
this remarkable account. No efforts were made to report on this event.
Even after acquisition of these incredible tapes, this valuable data has
not been addressed, and there is no indication that it will yet be pursued.</FONT></FONT></P>

<P><FONT COLOR="#FFFF00"><FONT SIZE=-1>Following my June 8 phone call,
I assumed that reportage of this incident would shortly commence. This
has not been the case, and I am under the impression that the staff of
Channel 33 longs for this matter to be swiftly swept aside and forgotten.</FONT></FONT></P>

<P><FONT COLOR="#FFFF00"><FONT SIZE=-1>During my June 12 conversation,
Adger even acknowledged that her initial fears were unfounded, and the
understandable concerns for the job safety of others were largely exaggerated.
Despite no expressed interest in addressing this incident with the Channel
33 news forum, Adger agreed with me that the tapes are shocking and are
of extreme news-interest.</FONT></FONT></P>
