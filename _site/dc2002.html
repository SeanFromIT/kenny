<blockquote><b><font size=+2>Subject: <u>UFO SIGHTING<br>
</u>Location: <u>WASHINGTON, D.C.<br>
</u>Date: <i><u>MONDAY, DECEMBER 16, 2002<br>
</u></i>Time: </font></b><u><font size=+2>Approximately 10:50 a.m.</font></u></blockquote>

<blockquote>In a series of E-mail messages beginning on Wednesday, December
18, a 38-year old college-educated (6-years) homemaker in the Washington
D.C. area sought to report a suspected UFO sighting. The witness expressed
her concern for privacy and would not release her phone number, choosing
to call me at my home telephone number that I provided to her. After the
exchange of several emails, arrangements were made for me to interview
her by telephone on Friday evening, December 20 at 9:00 p.m.</blockquote>

<blockquote>The witness informs that she located my email address from
a Google internet search under UFO sightings and also from an online message
board about UFO sightings from the Washington, D.C. area. She said that
she was aware of my investigations into the Washington D.C. UFO situation
from this past July.</blockquote>

<blockquote>The witness reports that at approximately 10:50 a.m., she was
inside her home, located at the northeast corner of Washington D.C., when
she heard 2 fighter jets fly over her neighborhood. She said that she had
lived on Air Force bases for 9-years and knew jet engines sounds, and after
hearing the aircraft commotion she thought: "Oh my gosh, are they escorting
someone out of the airspace?"</blockquote>

<blockquote>Stepping then to her window and looking to the south from her
vantage point, she was able to easily discern an unusual object that appeared
to be as large as a thumbnail at arms length, or comparable even to the
size of a full moon in the night sky. The object, she said, was bright
silver and reflected the sun (the sky conditions were clear with bright
blue skies, she said).</blockquote>

<blockquote>"I asked myself if this object was a wayward balloon," she
said, "but it flew at a fast speed and had a 'bouncing' motion, dipping
up and down."</blockquote>

<blockquote>The witness claims that the object was "way bigger" than an
airplane and that it flew from south to north at a speed comparable to
that of a quickly moving fighter jet. She said the duration of the sighting
was around 5-seconds.</blockquote>

<blockquote>The object was estimated to have occupied airspace within 3-miles
of her vantage pointed and situated over the&nbsp; northwest part of The
District or over Downtown D.C. near near the Lincoln Memorial or the Mall
area and flying at an elevation the witness said was "a bit higher than
a helicopter would fly."</blockquote>

<blockquote>She reports that the object was 'oval-shaped' and there was
no sound nor any smoke, The 'bouncing' flight conduct was most noticeable,
she said, and likened it to the pulse of a heart monitor. She said the
object was clearly of a 'silver-ish metal' composition and could distinctly
observe the sun reflecting off of it. The bottom half of the object was
darker and possibly due to shadow.</blockquote>

<blockquote>She could discern no structural detail and could not view any
apparent rotation of the object. She said that the UFO departed from her
view as it traveled to the north over a rooftop.</blockquote>

<blockquote>When asked if she could compare the shape to anything familiar,
she said the oval-shaped object was similar in appearance to the top end
of speed-stick deodorant.</blockquote>

<blockquote>The witness believes that if the jets were looking for the
UFO, they had 'just missed it'</blockquote>

<blockquote>Although hearing the jet aircraft activity, she did not see
the jets and did not necessarily think the UFO would have been traveling
in pursuit or even in the same direction as the jets.</blockquote>

<blockquote>"I've never seen anything like it before," she said. "I kept
thinking, 'I have no idea what that was.'"</blockquote>

<blockquote>After the incident, the witness said that she told her husband
and her sister about what she observed. She further advises that she has
never seen a UFO sighting previously.</blockquote>

<blockquote><b><font size=+1>FURTHER INQUIRY</font></b></blockquote>

<blockquote>In conjunction with this eyewitness claim of a UFO sighting,
there was a significant aerial event taking place in the Washington D.C.
area on the same date and time of the sighting report. Apparently it has
been reported by CNN news and also confirmed by NORAD that 2 F-16 fighter
jets were scrambled over the nations capitol to intercept a "potential
violator" of the restricted Washington D.C. airspace. The intercept attempt
apparently failed and the jets reportedly located nothing.</blockquote>

<blockquote>Hoping to assemble the details concerning this reported December
16, 2002 incident over Washington D.C. airspace, I sought to re-contact
Maj. Michael Snyder, a NORAD public affairs officer I had earlier communicated
with concerning a similar event over D.C. this past July. However, as per
automated response from Maj Snyder's E-mail address, he had apparently
been "demobilized" and no longer available. The response did offer a new
telephone number for any questions intended for the NORAD public affairs
desk.</blockquote>

<blockquote>I then called the NORAD public affairs office at 719-554-6889
(on Tuesday, December 17) and spoke with Sergeant Carpenter. I asked the
public affairs officer if I could acquire information concerning a news
report of a failed intercept mission of an unidentified object over Washington
D.C. airspace. The officer was interested to ascertain who I was and if
I was affiliated with the news media. I advised him that I had previously
spoke with Major Snyder concerning a similar occurrence earlier this year
and that I was a State Section Director for MUFON and had previously written
articles for the MUFON Journal and FATE MAGAZINE concerning the earlier
event.</blockquote>

<blockquote>Sergeant Carpenter asked what I wanted to know about the event
and I informed him that I sought to gather information concerning the date
and time of the incident, what was reported and by whom.</blockquote>

<blockquote>I also asked if there were any official statement or news release
available concerning the incident.</blockquote>

<blockquote>Sgt. Carpenter said he could only confirm that the incident
happened on Monday, December 16, 2002 and that no news release had been
offered concerning the incident. He then informed that my questions should
be handled by another person who was presently 'out of the office.' .</blockquote>

<blockquote>I left my name and phone number with him and he said that someone
would return my call. The call was not returned as of Thursday, December
19 prompting my return call to the NORAD public affairs office where I
was transferred to the voice-mail of Major Barry Venable.</blockquote>

<blockquote>On Tuesday, December 24, 2002, Major Barry Venable then responded
by E-mail and only offered that the event of December 16 did have similarities
to the situation from July but that in this instance the unidentified radar
target, which was a "momentary image on radar," was located inside the
restricted Washington D.C. airspace (as opposed to the July event when
the object was outside of and approaching the restricted air corridor).</blockquote>

<blockquote>When asked if there might be a potential explanation for the
radar target, Major Venable reported: "Flock of birds, big gust of wind,
radar anomaly are all potential explanations.</blockquote>

<blockquote>Further, Major Venable was not immediately aware of a second
event taking place over Washington D.C. later that evening, as reported
by WBAY ABC Channel 2 News of Greenbay, Wisconsin, in which a small plane
violated the airspace and later landed in West Virginia. When asked if
the plane had been identified and the pilot(s) approached for interrogation,
Major Venable answered: "I don't know about the late evening event you
mention-will have to research. If it did occur, we would not be the appropriate
agency to approach the pilot-that is a law enforcement function."</blockquote>

<blockquote><b><font size=+1>COMMENT</font></b></blockquote>

<blockquote>In conversation with the UFO eyewitness, I did not detect any
behavioral issue or ascertain any indication that the witness was inclined
toward alcohol or heavy medication. The witness sounded clear, sober and
lucid. The witness stressed her concern for anonymity and confidentiality,
saying that she did not want to see her name appear on the internet in
conjunction with this report.</blockquote>

<blockquote>While informing the claimant that I would respect her desire
for confidentiality, I also advised that having her account authenticated
by a third party is crucial to authenticating the report. I then suggested
the name of Joan Woodward, who took the Waldorf, MD UFO reports from last
August, and asked the witness if she would mind also speaking about the
sighting again. The witness seemed unsure about being contacted by other
UFO researchers and I suggested that I would confer with her through E-mail
and possibly send a phone number to her that she could call next week.</blockquote>

<blockquote>This report, concerning the Monday, December 16th sighting
of a UFO over Washington D.C. in conjunction with jet aircraft activity,
surfaced on Wednesday, December 18. On the previous afternoon, Tuesday,
December 17, it was revealed that NORAD had dispatched F-16 fighter jets
over the nation's capitol on Monday, December 16 to intercept an unidentified
radar target According to reports, the jets could supposedly find nothing.
UFO investigator Richard Hall reported to the Current Encounters research
list of also hearing jets passing low overhead from his vantage point in
the D.C. area at 10:50 a.m., which is same the time the claimant reports
hearing the aircraft commotion and observing the strange object. Later
that evening, jets were scrambled once again over the Washington D.C. area,
this time to intercept a small private plane that reportedly landed in
West Virginia.</blockquote>
